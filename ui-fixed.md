# Dashboard UI Fixed

I've fixed the dashboard UI issues. The window will now properly display when launched.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Struct Field Mismatches**: 
   - Added `healthy` field to `DomainInfo`
   - Fixed `SystemStatus` fields (`uptime_seconds`, `memory_usage_mb`)
   - Fixed field references in dashboard_window.rs

2. **In-Process Window Implementation**:
   - Created `dashboard_window.rs` for in-process Iced window
   - Added `dashboard-local` command to bypass renderer subprocess issues
   - Window runs directly in main process, avoiding NixOS library problems

3. **Renderer Support**:
   - Updated iced_simple.rs to properly handle Dashboard data type
   - Renderer now displays dashboard information instead of error

## How to Run the Dashboard

### Method 1: In-Process Window (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# In Nix shell
nix develop -c cargo run --bin ia -- dashboard-local
```

### Method 2: Test Example
```bash
nix develop -c cargo run --example test_dashboard_ui
```

### Method 3: Original Dashboard (with renderer subprocess)
```bash
nix develop -c cargo run --bin ia -- dashboard
```

## What You'll See

The dashboard window displays:
- **System Status**: NATS connection, total events, memory usage, uptime
- **Domain Health**: List of all domains with health indicators (✓/✗)
- **Active Dialogs**: Current AI dialog sessions
- **Recent Events**: Live event stream from all domains
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes every 100ms

## Key Features

- Dark theme for comfortable viewing
- Responsive layout with scrollable sections
- Color-coded health indicators (green = healthy, red = error)
- Auto-refresh for real-time monitoring

The UI is now fully functional and ready for development use!
