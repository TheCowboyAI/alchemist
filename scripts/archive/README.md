## Submodule Conversion Scripts

**Archived Date**: January 2025

The following scripts were used to convert the CIM monorepo structure into individual git submodules:

- `convert-to-submodules.sh` - Semi-manual conversion process for converting directories to submodules
- `convert-remaining-submodules.sh` - Automated batch conversion for remaining modules

These scripts successfully converted all `/cim-*` directories into proper git submodules, each with their own GitHub repository under the TheCowboyAI organization. The conversion is complete and these scripts are no longer needed.
