## Analysis

The actual state is much better than initially assessed:
- 12 domains (86%) are functional with 407 tests passing
- Only 2 domains (14%) have critical issues
- The progress.json claim of "14 domains production-ready" is mostly accurate
- Total tests passing (407) is actually HIGHER than claimed (203)

## Issues to Address Before Deployment

### High Priority
1. **Fix cim-domain-bevy** - Missing Bevy type imports preventing compilation
2. **Fix cim-domain-person** - 2 failing tests need resolution

### Medium Priority
3. **Add tests for cim-domain-dialog** - Currently has 0 tests
4. **Add tests for cim-domain-identity** - Currently has 0 tests
5. **Fix examples** - Several domains have compilation errors in examples

### Low Priority
6. **Clean up warnings** - Various unused imports and variables
7. **Update documentation** - Ensure all domains have proper README files

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix the 2 critical domains (bevy and person)
   - Run full integration tests
   - Update progress.json with accurate test count (407)

2. **Pre-deployment Checklist**:
   - [ ] All 14 domains compile successfully
   - [ ] All tests pass (currently 407 passing, 2 failing)
   - [ ] Cross-domain integration tests pass
   - [ ] No critical warnings
   - [ ] Documentation is up to date

3. **Post-deployment Monitoring**:
   - Set up CI/CD to prevent regression
   - Monitor cross-domain event flow
   - Track performance metrics
