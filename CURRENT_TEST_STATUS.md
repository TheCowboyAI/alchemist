# Current Test Status Report

## Date: 2025-01-11

## Summary

After fixing several critical compilation errors, the current test status is:

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ `GraphType::General` - Fixed import paths in tests
2. ✅ `ContentType::Text` - Changed to `ContentType::Markdown`
3. ✅ Bevy API deprecations - Fixed `windows.get_single()` → `windows.single()`
4. ✅ Module exports - Added `deployment_automation` to lib.rs
5. ✅ Import corrections - Fixed `DeploymentPipeline` imports

### Remaining Critical Issues
1. ❌ **bevy-patched directory missing** - Prevents compilation of domains that depend on Bevy
2. ❌ **cim-domain-identity** - Cannot be added to workspace due to missing bevy-patched
3. ❌ **Compilation timeout** - Build process takes >2 minutes, indicating deeper issues

## Test Execution Status

### What We Know Works (from previous reports):
- **Integration Tests**: 25/25 passed
  - Cross-domain integration: 6/6
  - Error handling: 8/8
  - Performance benchmarks: 6/6
  - Simple tests: 5/5

- **Domain Tests**:
  - cim-domain-conceptualspaces: 27 passed
  - cim-domain-document: 5 passed
  - cim-domain-graph: 100 passed
  - cim-domain-location: 29 passed
  - cim-domain-organization: 56 passed
  - cim-domain-workflow: 38 passed

- **Performance Results**:
  - Event publishing: 1,013,638 events/sec
  - Concurrent operations: 2,389,116 events/sec
  - Memory usage: 1.3KB per event

### Current Blockers
1. **Missing bevy-patched directory**
   - Required by: cim-domain-identity, cim-domain-bevy, cim-domain-agent
   - Impact: Cannot run tests for these domains
   - Solution: Need to restore bevy-patched or update dependencies

2. **Long compilation times**
   - Even simple tests timeout after 2 minutes
   - Indicates possible circular dependencies or other build issues

3. **Workspace configuration**
   - Several domains are excluded from workspace
   - This prevents unified testing and dependency resolution

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Investigate why bevy-patched is missing
2. Consider removing Bevy dependencies temporarily to test core functionality
3. Run individual package tests that don't depend on Bevy

### Test Strategy
1. Focus on domains that compile successfully:
   - cim-domain
   - cim-ipld
   - cim-domain-conceptualspaces
   - cim-domain-workflow

2. Create minimal test suite excluding Bevy-dependent code

3. Fix workspace configuration to include all domains

## Test Coverage Status

From USER_STORIES.md:
- 52 user stories defined
- 100% have tests written
- ~10% can execute due to compilation issues

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made fixing type errors and imports, the missing bevy-patched directory and resulting compilation issues prevent full test execution. The core domain logic appears solid based on previous test results, but the UI/rendering layer cannot be tested without resolving the Bevy dependency issue.
