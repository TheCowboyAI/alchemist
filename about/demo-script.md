# CIM Live Demo Script

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /git/thecowboyai/alchemist

# Activate the development environment
direnv allow
nix develop

# Start NATS server (in separate terminal)
nats-server -js
```

## Demo 1: Workflow Visualization

### Start the Workflow Demo

```bash
# Run the interactive workflow demo
nix run .#cim-domain-bevy -- --example workflow_demo
```

### Demo Talk Track

1. **Opening (0:30)**
   - "Let me show you how CIM transforms business workflows from invisible code into visual, interactive processes."
   - "This is a real document approval workflow that typically takes 5-7 days."

2. **Visual Design (1:00)**
   - Click on the Start node to begin
   - "Notice how each step lights up as it becomes active"
   - "The diamond represents a decision point"
   - "Parallel steps can execute simultaneously"

3. **Real-time Tracking (0:45)**
   - Click through the workflow
   - "Every action is tracked in real-time"
   - "Stakeholders can see exactly where documents are"
   - "Bottlenecks become immediately visible"

4. **Business Impact (0:30)**
   - "This visibility alone reduces process time by 40%"
   - "Complete audit trail for compliance"
   - "No more 'where is my document?' emails"

## Demo 2: Graph Analysis

### Run the Graph Analysis Demo

```bash
# Start the graph analysis example
nix run . -- --example graph_analysis
```

### Key Points to Highlight

```rust
// Show these capabilities:

// 1. Automatic relationship discovery
let dependencies = graph.find_dependencies("PaymentService");
// Finds: OrderService, CustomerService, InventoryService

// 2. Impact analysis
let impact = graph.analyze_change_impact("PaymentService");
// Shows: "23 services affected, 142 workflows impacted"

// 3. Optimization suggestions
let suggestions = ai_agent.optimize_graph(graph);
// "Merge CustomerService and ProfileService - 87% overlap"
```

## Demo 3: Event Stream Visualization

### Start Event Streaming Demo

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start event generator
nix run . -- --example event_generator

# Terminal 2: Start visualization
nix run .#cim-domain-bevy -- --example event_visualization
```

### Visual Effects to Point Out

1. **Event Ripples**
   - "Each event creates a ripple effect"
   - "Color indicates event type"
   - "Size shows event importance"

2. **Flow Patterns**
   - "Notice how events flow between nodes"
   - "Particles show data movement"
   - "Bottlenecks glow red"

3. **Real-time Metrics**
   - "Event rate: 1M+ per second"
   - "Zero message loss"
   - "Sub-millisecond latency"

## Demo 4: AI-Powered Insights

### Run AI Analysis Demo

```bash
# Start the AI integration demo
nix run . -- --example ai_insights
```

### Demonstration Flow

```rust
// 1. Ask natural language question
let question = "Why is order processing slow on Mondays?";
let answer = ai_agent.analyze_pattern(question);

// Shows: "Monday order volume is 3x average. 
//         PaymentService becomes bottleneck at 2x load.
//         Recommendation: Scale PaymentService on Mondays."

// 2. Predictive analysis
let prediction = ai_agent.predict_failure_points(next_week_load);
// "87% probability of InventoryService timeout on Black Friday"

// 3. Optimization suggestions
let optimizations = ai_agent.suggest_improvements(current_workflow);
// "Parallelize steps 3 and 4 - save 1.2 days per process"
```

## Demo 5: Cross-Domain Integration

### Git to Graph Demo

```bash
# Analyze actual CIM repository
nix run . -- --example git_integration --repo .
```

### What to Show

1. **Automatic Discovery**
   - "Watch as CIM analyzes our own codebase"
   - "103 events generated from Git history"
   - "Complete development workflow emerges"

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   - "See how commits relate to features"
   - "Dependencies automatically discovered"
   - "No manual documentation needed"

3. **Development Insights**
   - "Average feature takes 3.2 days"
   - "Testing bottleneck identified"
   - "Suggest parallelization opportunities"

## Demo 6: Performance Showcase

### Run Performance Benchmarks

```bash
# Run the performance demo
nix run . -- --example performance_demo
```

### Metrics to Highlight

```
Event Creation:      779,352/sec  (7.8x target)
Event Publishing:  1,013,638/sec  (101x target)  
Query Response:         <10ms     (15x faster)
Memory Usage:         1.3KB/event (7.5x better)
```

### Live Stress Test

```bash
# Generate 1 million events
nix run . -- --example stress_test --events 1000000

# Show real-time dashboard
nix run .#monitoring -- --dashboard performance
```

## Demo 7: Business Value Calculator

### Interactive ROI Demo

```bash
# Start ROI calculator
nix run . -- --example roi_calculator
```

### Input Customer Scenarios

```
Company Size: 1000 employees
Current Process Time: 5 days
Manual Steps: 12
Integration Points: 8

Results:
- Time Savings: 40% (2 days)
- Cost Savings: $3.2M/year
- ROI: 4.8 month payback
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NATS not running**
   ```bash
   # Check NATS status
   nats server check
   
   # Restart if needed
   nats-server -js &
   ```

2. **Graphics issues**
   ```bash
   # Use software rendering
   export WGPU_BACKEND=gl
   nix run . -- --example workflow_demo
   ```

3. **Performance concerns**
   ```bash
   # Run in release mode
   nix build
   ./result/bin/alchemist --example performance_demo
   ```
