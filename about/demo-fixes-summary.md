# Demo Fixes Summary

## Fixed Demo Examples

### 1. workflow_demo.rs (cim-domain-bevy)
**Issues Fixed:**
- Updated deprecated Rust string interpolation syntax (e.g., `{variable}` → `{}`, variable)
- Fixed Bevy API changes:
  - Removed unused imports and features that weren't available with limited Bevy features
  - Updated from `EventWriter::send` to `EventWriter::write`
  - Fixed `Text` API usage
  - Simplified to work with MinimalPlugins instead of DefaultPlugins
- Added missing `Debug` derives to enums
- Fixed `Local<u32>` dereferencing

**Result:** Demo now compiles and runs as a console-based workflow visualization that prints the workflow structure.

### 2. state_machine_demo.rs (cim-domain-workflow)
**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed all string interpolation syntax errors (missing closing parentheses and incorrect formatting)
- Updated from old Rust formatting style to current standards
- Fixed state machine guard to check for meaningful context (not just internal metadata)
- Updated demo to handle the fact that `start()` adds `_started_by` to context

**Result:** Demo now compiles and runs successfully, demonstrating:
- Workflow state machine with proper transitions
- Guard conditions preventing invalid transitions
- Step execution and completion
- Workflow progress tracking
- State transition history

### 3. workflow_demo_simple.rs (NEW - cim-domain-bevy)
**Created:** A new simple workflow demo that works without graphics dependencies
- Uses MinimalPlugins instead of full Bevy graphics stack
- Demonstrates workflow concepts with console output
- Shows node types, edges, and workflow progression
- Exits cleanly after completion

**Result:** Successfully demonstrates workflow visualization concepts without requiring graphics.

## Summary

All demos now compile and run successfully, demonstrating:
1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Workflow aggregates with proper state management
2. **State Machines**: Formal state transitions with guards and effects
3. **Event Sourcing**: Event-driven workflow progression
4. **Graph Visualization**: Node and edge relationships (console-based)
5. **Business Process Management**: Document approval workflow example

The fixes ensure compatibility with current Rust syntax and the limited Bevy features available in the project.

## Key Learnings

1. **Bevy Feature Limitations**: The cim-domain-bevy project uses a very limited set of Bevy features (only `bevy_log`, `bevy_color`, `bevy_render`), which means demos need to be simplified to work without UI, text rendering, or advanced graphics features.

2. **Rust Version Changes**: The demos had outdated Rust syntax, particularly around string formatting. Modern Rust requires explicit formatting parameters.

3. **API Evolution**: Bevy's API has evolved, with methods like `send()` being deprecated in favor of `write()`.

## Running the Fixed Demos

```bash
# Workflow visualization demo (console output)
cd cim-domain-bevy
cargo run --example workflow_demo

# State machine demo
cd cim-domain-workflow
cargo run --example state_machine_demo

# ContextGraph export demo
cd cim-domain-workflow
cargo run --example contextgraph_export
```

The demos are now ready for the investor presentation!
