# Demo Fixes Summary

## Fixed Demo Examples

### 1. workflow_demo.rs (cim-domain-bevy)
**Issues Fixed:**
- Updated deprecated Rust string interpolation syntax (e.g., `{variable}` â†’ `{}`, variable)
- Fixed Bevy API changes:
  - Removed unused imports and features that weren't available with limited Bevy features
  - Updated from `EventWriter::send` to `EventWriter::write`
  - Fixed `Text` API usage
  - Simplified to work with MinimalPlugins instead of DefaultPlugins
- Added missing `Debug` derives to enums
- Fixed `Local<u32>` dereferencing

**Result:** Demo now compiles and runs as a console-based workflow visualization that prints the workflow structure.

### 2. state_machine_demo.rs (cim-domain-workflow)
**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed all string interpolation syntax errors (missing closing parentheses and incorrect formatting)
- Updated from old Rust formatting style to current style

**Result:** Demo now compiles successfully.

### 3. contextgraph_export.rs
**Status:** Already working correctly, no fixes needed.

## Key Learnings

1. **Bevy Feature Limitations**: The cim-domain-bevy project uses a very limited set of Bevy features (only `bevy_log`, `bevy_color`, `bevy_render`), which means demos need to be simplified to work without UI, text rendering, or advanced graphics features.

2. **Rust Version Changes**: The demos had outdated Rust syntax, particularly around string formatting. Modern Rust requires explicit formatting parameters.

3. **API Evolution**: Bevy's API has evolved, with methods like `send()` being deprecated in favor of `write()`.

## Running the Fixed Demos

```bash
# Workflow visualization demo (console output)
cd cim-domain-bevy
cargo run --example workflow_demo

# State machine demo
cd cim-domain-workflow
cargo run --example state_machine_demo

# ContextGraph export demo
cd cim-domain-workflow
cargo run --example contextgraph_export
```

The demos are now ready for the investor presentation!
