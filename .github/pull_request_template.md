## Domain-Driven Design Compliance

<!-- Ensure your changes follow DDD principles -->

### Bounded Context Integrity
- [ ] Changes are contained within appropriate bounded context
- [ ] No direct dependencies between bounded contexts (only through events)
- [ ] Ubiquitous language is maintained and documented

### Event Sourcing & CQRS
- [ ] All state changes flow through domain events
- [ ] Commands and queries are properly separated
- [ ] Event names follow past-tense naming convention
- [ ] Event payloads are immutable and well-designed

### Entity Component System
- [ ] Components are pure data (no behavior)
- [ ] Systems operate on specific component combinations
- [ ] No direct ECS access from domain layer
- [ ] Proper async/sync bridge usage

## Testing

<!-- Describe the testing approach and ensure comprehensive coverage -->

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for domain logic (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for system interactions
- [ ] NATS message handling tests
- [ ] Event sourcing replay tests
- [ ] Performance/stress tests (if applicable)

### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests run in headless mode (`BEVY_HEADLESS=1`)
- [ ] No unwrap() in domain logic tests
- [ ] Tests include Mermaid diagrams in rustdoc
- [ ] All event handlers have tests
- [ ] All command handlers have tests

### Test Results
```
# Paste test run output here
$ nix build
$ nix run -- test
```

## Documentation

<!-- Ensure proper documentation is included -->

- [ ] **Rustdoc**: Public APIs have comprehensive documentation
- [ ] **Architecture**: Updated relevant design documents in `/doc/design/`
- [ ] **User Guide**: Updated user-facing documentation if applicable
- [ ] **Examples**: Added or updated examples demonstrating the feature
- [ ] **CHANGELOG**: Added entry to appropriate CHANGELOG file

## Code Quality

<!-- Verify code meets our quality standards -->

### Code Style
- [ ] `nix flake check` passes without warnings
- [ ] `cargo fmt` applied
- [ ] `cargo clippy` clean (no warnings)
- [ ] Followed Rust naming conventions
- [ ] Applied DDD naming guidelines

### Security & Performance
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented

## Migration & Compatibility

<!-- For breaking changes or significant modifications -->

### Breaking Changes
- [ ] **None** - This PR maintains backward compatibility
- [ ] **Minor** - Changes require documentation updates only
- [ ] **Major** - Changes require migration guide and version bump

### Migration Guide
<!-- If breaking changes exist, provide clear migration instructions -->

```rust
// Before
old_api_call();

// After  
new_api_call();
```

## Deployment & Operations

<!-- Consider operational impact -->

- [ ] **Configuration**: No new configuration required
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: No infrastructure changes needed
- [ ] **Database**: No schema changes required
- [ ] **NATS**: No subject/stream configuration changes needed
