# Alchemist System - Working Demonstration

## Current Status: OPERATIONAL

The Alchemist system has been tested and verified to work. Below is concrete evidence of functionality:

## 1. Dialog Domain - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

test value_objects::tests::test_turn_creation ... ok

test result: ok. 21 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

### Working Example Output
```
=== Dialog Domain Example ===

1. Starting dialog...
   ✓ Dialog started with ID: c95055f1-3adf-4efb-8a85-63651a87a9b8

2. User sending first message...
   ✓ User: "Hello! I need help with my account."

3. Agent responding...
   ✓ Agent: "I'd be happy to help you with your account!"

4. User providing more details...
   ✓ User: "I forgot my password and can't log in."

5. Agent providing structured solution...
   ✓ Agent: [Structured response with password reset steps]

6. Querying dialog information...
   Dialog type: Support
   Status: Active
   Turns: 4
   Participants: 1

7. Ending dialog...
   ✓ Dialog ended successfully

8. Final dialog state:
   Status: Ended
   Average response time: 215ms
   Sentiment trend: 0.60
   Coherence score: 0.92
```

## 2. Collaboration Domain - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

### Tests Passing
```bash
$ cargo test -p cim-domain-collaboration --lib
running 7 tests
test aggregate::tests::test_editing_locks ... ok
test aggregate::tests::test_session_creation ... ok
test aggregate::tests::test_user_join_leave ... ok
test handlers::tests::test_editing_locks ... ok
test handlers::tests::test_join_leave_session ... ok
test projections::tests::test_session_projection ... ok
test queries::tests::test_collaboration_queries ... ok

test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

### Working Example Output
```
=== Real-Time Collaboration Demo ===

Created graph for collaboration: 54622743-baef-40e5-9e23-9a1c55e6de1c

1. Alice joining collaboration session...
   ✓ Alice joined with color #FF6B6B

2. Bob joining collaboration session...
   ✓ Bob joined with color #4ECDC4

3. Current session state:
   Session ID: e707b2c1-3ed6-4cb7-a163-8d37acb73cdb
   Active users: 2

4. Alice moving cursor...
   ✓ Cursor moved to (100, 200, 0)

5. Bob selecting nodes...
   ✓ Selected 2 nodes

6. Alice requesting to edit node...
   ✓ Started editing node 4ef483be-9354-4e7c-af2e-36c5ea1b67e2

7. Bob trying to edit the same node...
   ✗ Cannot edit - node is locked by another user

8. Alice finishing edit...
   ✓ Finished editing node

9. Collaboration statistics:
    Active sessions: 1
    Total users: 2
    Average users per session: 2.0
```

## 3. Concrete APIs Implemented

### Dialog Domain API
- **Event Types**: DialogStarted, TurnAdded, DialogEnded, DialogPaused, DialogResumed
- **Commands**: StartDialog, AddTurn, EndDialog, PauseDialog, ResumeDialog
- **Queries**: GetDialogById, GetActiveDialogs, GetDialogsByParticipant, SearchDialogsByText, GetDialogStatistics
- **Projections**: SimpleDialogView with real-time updates

### Collaboration Domain API
- **Event Types**: UserJoinedSession, UserLeftSession, CursorMoved, SelectionChanged, EditingStarted, EditingFinished
- **Commands**: JoinSession, LeaveSession, UpdateCursor, UpdateSelection, StartEditing, FinishEditing
- **Queries**: GetSession, GetAllSessions, GetGraphSessions, GetUserSession, GetStatistics
- **Features**: Real-time cursor tracking, editing locks, session management

## 4. Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### Event-Driven Architecture ✅
- All state changes produce domain events
- Events are immutable and append-only
- Event handlers update projections asynchronously

### CQRS Pattern ✅
- Commands return only acknowledgments
- Queries run against optimized read models
- Complete separation of write and read paths

### Domain-Driven Design ✅
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Value objects for immutable data
- Aggregates maintain consistency boundaries

## 5. How to Run the Demonstrations

### Run Dialog Domain Tests and Demo
```bash
# Run tests
cargo test -p cim-domain-dialog --lib

# Run interactive demo
cargo run --example dialog_demo -p cim-domain-dialog
```

### Run Collaboration Domain Tests and Demo
```bash
# Run tests  
cargo test -p cim-domain-collaboration --lib

# Run interactive demo
cargo run --example collaboration_demo -p cim-domain-collaboration
```
