# Release v0.4.0 - Identity Domain ECS Refactoring

## üéâ Major Architectural Improvement

This release marks a significant milestone in the CIM (Composable Information Machine) project with the complete refactoring of the Identity Domain to use pure ECS (Entity Component System) architecture.

## üöÄ What's New

### Identity Domain Transformation
The Identity Domain has been completely rebuilt from the ground up using Bevy ECS patterns:

- **Pure ECS Architecture**: Removed all legacy non-ECS code for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- **Comprehensive Components**: Created ECS components for:
  - Core identity management
  - Relationship tracking and validation
  - Workflow orchestration
  - Projection and view management
- **Full System Implementation**: 
  - Lifecycle management (create, update, merge, archive)
  - Relationship systems (establish, validate, traverse, expire)
  - Workflow processing (start, step processing, completion, timeouts)
  - Projection systems for optimized read models
  - Verification systems for identity validation

### Business Rule Enforcement
- Built aggregate pattern for business rule enforcement while leveraging ECS
- Created query operations for read-only access patterns
- Developed projection systems for optimized read models

### Documentation Suite
This release includes a comprehensive documentation package:

- **User Stories**: 7 epics covering all identity domain functionality
- **API Documentation**: Complete reference with code examples
- **Developer Guide**: Architecture overview and integration patterns
- **Example Application**: Working demo showing complex verification workflows
- **Quick Start Guide**: Get up and running quickly with the new architecture

## üìä Impact

- **72 files changed**
- **10,880 lines added**
- **706 lines removed**
- **100% compilation success** with all warnings resolved

## üîó Integration

The refactored Identity Domain maintains full compatibility with other CIM domains:
- Delegates person details to `cim-domain-person`
- Delegates organization details to `cim-domain-organization`
- Delegates authentication to `cim-domain-policy`
- Delegates cryptography to `cim-security`
- Delegates key management to `cim-keys`

## üôè Acknowledgments

This refactoring represents a major step forward in the CIM project's goal of creating a fully event-driven, ECS-based architecture for information management systems.
