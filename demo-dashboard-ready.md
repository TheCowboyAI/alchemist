# Dashboard Window Implementation Complete

I've implemented an in-process dashboard window that will actually display on screen. This addresses the issue where the renderer subprocess was failing on NixOS.

## What's Been Done

1. **Created `dashboard_window.rs`**: A complete Iced-based dashboard implementation that runs in the main process
2. **Added `dashboard-local` command**: Launches the window without spawning a subprocess
3. **Implemented full dashboard UI** with:
   - System status display (NATS connection, memory, events)
   - Domain health monitoring
   - Active dialogs list
   - Recent events viewer
   - Auto-refresh every 100ms

## To Run the Dashboard

```bash
# In the Nix development shell
nix develop -c cargo run --bin ia -- dashboard-local
```

This will show a proper UI window with all the dashboard information.

## Key Features

- **No subprocess spawning**: Runs directly in the main process, avoiding NixOS library issues
- **Real-time updates**: Refreshes data every 100ms
- **Dark theme**: Professional appearance
- **Responsive layout**: Sections resize properly

The dashboard is now ready for developers to use and see the system status visually.
