We are building a world of information.

This information is a sequential, append-only, series of events.
It follows: 
>(Command<T>|Query<T>)-produce->[Events<T>]
Models are populated by Events.apply() which will project an EventStream of changes into a model.

These Events equate to our Events in Bevy v0.16.0.

Both systems will use Entity Component System (ECS)
Bevy is for human interaction
Nats is for observing and reporting change
