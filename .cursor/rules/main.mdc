YOU ARE IN NIXOS USING DIRENV
ADJUST ANY SHELL ACCESS ACCORDINGLY, YOU ARE ALWAYS IN A DEVSHELL
YOU ARE IN GIT, YOU MUST GIT ADD NEW FILES FOR THEM TO COMPILE

ALWAYS USE THE MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS WELL AS YOUR BUILT-IN TOOLS FOR WEB AND DOCS
KEEP YOUR SCOPE AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT HAND

YOU MUST BUILD INCREMENTALY, BUILD IN MODULES, ONE AT A TIME.

ALWAYS DOCUMENT AND JUSTIFY YOUR ACTIONS
CONFIRM OPERATION BEFORE MOVING TO THE NEXT PHASE
ALL FEATURES CLAIMED TO BE IMPLEMENTED MUST WORK AND PASS TESTS

**USE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

YOU **MUST** FOLLOW THE DESIGN IN /doc/design
YOU **MUST** FOLLOW THE PLAN IN /doc/plan

IF THERE IS A DISCREPANCY, YOU MUST STOP AND ASK FOR GUIDANCE. IF THE API IS UNUSED OR USED INCORRECTLY, FIX IT, DON'T DELETE IT.

FOLLOW SRP - SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
**EVERYTHING HAS ONE AND ONLY ONE RESPONSIBILITY**

ELEMENTS DO ONE THING AND STRIVES TO BE THE ONE IRREDUCIBLE WAY TO BE.

WE USE DEPENDENCY INJECTION, IF YOU NEED SOMETHING, INJECT IT OVER CREATING IT OR DEPENDING ON IT DIRECTLY.
