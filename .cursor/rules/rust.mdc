When planning to write code, ALWAYS respect the documentation in /doc
If instructions in /doc are unclear for the propose functionality, ASK FOR CLARITY and add to the documentation before writing code.
YOU HAVE MANY EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW IN /examples

NEVER, EVER DOWNGRADE A RUST LIBRARY.
IF THE CARGO.TOML FILE SPECIFIES A VERSION, YOU MAY ONLY GO UP, NEVER DOWN.

DO NOT MAKE TEMPORARY DOWNGRADES, FIX THE PROBLEM AT HAND.

USE `nix run` and `nix build` over `cargo run`
