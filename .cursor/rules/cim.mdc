We are building a world of information.

This information is a sequential, append-only, series of events.
It follows: 
>(Command<T>|Query<T>)-produce->[Events<T>]
Models are populated by Events.apply() which will project an EventStream of changes into a model.

These Events equate to our Events in Bevy v0.16.0.

Both systems will use Entity Component System (ECS)
We define several Boundaries and Hierarchies using Domain Driven Design (DDD) Priciples
Bevy is for human interaction
Nats is for observing and reporting change
