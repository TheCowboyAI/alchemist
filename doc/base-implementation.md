# Alchemist Graph Editor - Base Implementation

## Overview

This document captures the base implementation of the Alchemist graph editor as of the successful resolution of system conflicts and rendering issues. This serves as a stable foundation for future feature development.

## Current State

### âœ… Working Features

1. **Stable Rendering Pipeline**
   - No flashing when switching between 2D/3D modes
   - Proper change detection prevents unnecessary re-renders
   - Clean separation between view modes

2. **System Architecture**
   - Well-defined execution phases using SystemSets
   - Predictable system ordering prevents race conditions
   - Event-driven architecture with proper event processing order

3. **Basic Graph Operations**
   - Create nodes (Ctrl+N)
   - Clear graph (Ctrl+K)
   - View mode switching (Tab/V)
   - Basic node rendering in both 2D and 3D

4. **Camera Controls**
   - 3D: Orbit (right-click drag), Pan (middle+shift), Zoom (scroll)
   - 2D: Pan (middle-click drag), Zoom (scroll)
   - Smooth transitions between modes

5. **UI Framework**
   - Menu bar with file operations
   - Control panel for graph operations
   - Inspector panel for node properties
   - DPI scaling support (Ctrl+/-, Ctrl+0)

### ðŸš§ Limited Functionality

While the foundation is stable, the following features are not yet implemented:

1. **Graph Editing**
   - No edge creation UI
   - No node deletion
   - No node movement/dragging
   - No multi-selection

2. **Persistence**
   - File loading/saving UI exists but needs connection
   - JSON serialization framework in place but not fully integrated

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Graph algorithms (framework exists, not exposed)
   - Merkle DAG integration (structure exists, not utilized)
   - Pattern library (defined but not accessible)
   - Subgraph support (partial implementation)

## Architecture Highlights

### System Execution Order
```
1. Input Phase
   - Keyboard/mouse input
   - Camera controls

2. Event Processing Phase
   - Node creation events
   - Edge creation events (deferred)
   - Selection events

3. State Update Phase
   - Node visual updates
   - Selection highlights
   - Camera transitions

4. Change Detection Phase
   - Detect what changed this frame
   - Update change flags

5. UI Phase
   - Menu bar
   - Panels
   - Inspector

6. Render Prep Phase (PostUpdate)
   - Only render what changed
   - Conditional rendering based on change flags
```

### Key Resources
- `GraphData` - Central graph storage using petgraph
- `GraphChangeFlags` - Frame-to-frame change tracking
- `EdgeMeshTracker` - Edge rendering state
- `GraphState` - Selection and interaction state

### Event System
- Proper event ordering ensures edges can't be created before nodes
- Deferred edge events handle timing issues
- All events processed in predictable order

## Performance Characteristics

- **Rendering**: Only updates when changes detected
- **Change Detection**: Efficient flag-based system
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead with component-based architecture
- **Frame Rate**: Stable due to conditional system execution

## Development Guidelines

1. **Adding New Features**
   - Place systems in appropriate SystemSet phase
   - Use change detection flags when adding rendering
   - Follow event-driven patterns for user actions

2. **System Placement**
   - Input gathering â†’ Input phase
   - Event handling â†’ EventProcessing phase
   - State mutations â†’ StateUpdate phase
   - Change detection â†’ ChangeDetection phase
   - UI rendering â†’ UI phase
   - 3D/2D rendering â†’ RenderPrep phase

3. **Best Practices**
   - Always use proper system ordering
   - Implement run conditions for expensive systems
   - Update change flags when modifying graph state
   - Test view mode transitions for any new rendering

## Known Stable Points

1. **View Mode Switching**: Smooth, no flashing
2. **Node Rendering**: Consistent in both 2D/3D
3. **System Ordering**: No race conditions
4. **Event Processing**: Reliable and ordered
5. **UI Rendering**: No conflicts or flickering

## Next Development Phase

With this stable base, the next features to implement are:

1. **Interactive Node Manipulation**
   - Click to select nodes
   - Drag to move nodes
   - Delete selected nodes

2. **Edge Creation**
   - Click and drag between nodes
   - Visual feedback during creation
   - Proper edge rendering

3. **File Operations**
   - Connect save/load to actual file system
   - Implement graph serialization

4. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Expose pathfinding
   - Add layout algorithms
   - Implement graph analysis tools

## Testing Checklist

Before adding new features, verify:
- [ ] Tab/V switches views without flashing
- [ ] Ctrl+N creates a node at origin
- [ ] Ctrl+K clears the graph
- [ ] Camera controls work in both modes
- [ ] UI panels render without flickering
- [ ] No console errors or warnings about system conflicts

## Conclusion

This base implementation provides a solid foundation with proper architecture, stable rendering, and no system conflicts. While functionality is limited, the framework is in place for rapid feature development without the technical debt of rendering issues or race conditions.
