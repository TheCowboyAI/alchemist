### 📁 progress/
Progress tracking, including the main `progress.json` file and milestone documentation.

### 📁 publish/
Documentation prepared for external publication, organized by audience (architecture, business, domains, technical).

### 📁 qa/
Quality assurance documentation, test plans, and validation reports.

### 📁 research/
Background research, theoretical foundations, and exploratory documentation.

### 📁 summaries/

## Documentation Standards

1. **Lowercase Filenames**: All files use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `design-document.md`, not `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`)
2. **Current vs. Archived**: Only current, actively-used documents remain in primary folders
3. **Clear Organization**: Each folder has a specific purpose - don't mix document types
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Completed or outdated documents move to `/archive` with dated subfolder

## Recent Changes (v0.4.1)

- Cleaned up `/doc/design` - moved completed implementations to archive
- Renamed all files to lowercase convention
- Removed nested `current/` folders - all active documents at top level
- Archived workflow implementation documentation

## Finding Documentation

- **For current architecture**: See `/design`
- **For implementation plans**: See `/plan`
- **For API reference**: See `/api`
- **For historical context**: See `/archive`
