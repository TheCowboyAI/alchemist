# Phase 2: Selection System Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive selection system as a separate bounded context following Domain-Driven Design principles.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Selection Bounded Context Structure ✅
Created a new selection context with proper DDD structure:
- `src/contexts/selection/mod.rs` - Module definition
- `src/contexts/selection/domain.rs` - Domain entities and components
- `src/contexts/selection/events.rs` - Selection events
- `src/contexts/selection/services.rs` - Selection services
- `src/contexts/selection/plugin.rs` - Bevy plugin integration

### 2. Domain Entities ✅
- **SelectionState**: Resource tracking selected nodes and edges
- **SelectionMode**: Enum for Single, Multiple, Box, and Lasso modes
- **Selectable**: Component marking entities as selectable
- **Selected**: Component marking currently selected entities
- **SelectionHighlight**: Component for visual feedback configuration
- **SelectionBox**: Component for box selection visualization

### 3. Selection Events ✅
Implemented comprehensive event system:
- **SelectionChanged**: Fired when selection state changes
- **SelectNode/DeselectNode**: Node selection requests
- **SelectEdge/DeselectEdge**: Edge selection requests
- **SelectionModeChanged**: Mode switching events
- **StartBoxSelection/UpdateBoxSelection/CompleteBoxSelection**: Box selection flow
- **SelectAll/InvertSelection**: Advanced selection operations

### 4. Selection Services ✅
- **ManageSelection**: Handles selection state management
- **HighlightSelection**: Manages visual feedback for selections
- **ProcessSelectionInput**: Handles mouse and keyboard input
- **PerformBoxSelection**: Implements box selection functionality
- **AdvancedSelection**: Implements select all and invert operations

### 5. Input Controls ✅
- **Left Click**: Select single node/edge
- **Ctrl+Click**: Add to selection (multi-select)
- **Shift+Click**: Start box selection
- **Right Click**: Clear all selections
- **Ctrl+A**: Select all visible entities
- **Ctrl+I**: Invert current selection
- **Tab**: Cycle through selection modes

### 6. Visual Feedback ✅
- Selected nodes/edges get golden highlight with emissive glow
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Original materials properly restored on deselection

### 7. Integration Updates ✅
- Removed old selection code from visualization context
- Updated visualization plugin to remove duplicate systems
- Added Selectable component to nodes and edges in graph management
- Integrated Panorbit Camera for better 3D navigation

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Selection logic completely separated from visualization
- Clean event-driven communication between contexts
- No direct dependencies between contexts

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Efficient raycasting for selection
- Proper use of Bevy's change detection
- Minimal material updates

### 3. Extensibility
- Easy to add new selection modes
- Simple to customize visual feedback
- Event-driven architecture allows for easy integration

## Camera Controls (Panorbit)
- **Right Mouse**: Orbit camera
- **Middle Mouse**: Pan camera
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. **Implement Edge Selection Improvements**
   - Better edge hit detection (currently using simple sphere collision)
   - Visual feedback specifically for edges

2. **Add Selection Persistence**
   - Save/load selection states
   - Undo/redo for selections

3. **Implement Lasso Selection**
   - Free-form selection tool
   - Visual feedback for lasso path

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add metrics for selection operations
   - Optimize for large graphs

5. **Selection-based Operations**
   - Delete selected entities
   - Group/ungroup selections
   - Apply operations to selected items

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Single node selection
- [x] Multi-node selection (Ctrl+Click)
- [x] Edge selection
- [x] Clear selection (Right Click)
- [x] Select all (Ctrl+A)
- [x] Invert selection (Ctrl+I)
- [x] Selection mode switching (Tab)
- [x] Visual feedback for selected items
- [x] Camera controls with Panorbit

## Known Issues

1. Edge selection uses simple sphere collision - could be improved for better accuracy
2. Box selection visual feedback (the selection box itself) is not rendered yet
3. Hover effects could be more prominent

## Summary

Phase 2 successfully implements a robust, DDD-compliant selection system that provides:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive selection capabilities
- Intuitive user controls
- Proper visual feedback
- Foundation for future enhancements

The system is ready for use and provides a solid foundation for Phase 3 enhancements.
