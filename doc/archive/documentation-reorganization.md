# Documentation Reorganization

## Date: December 2024

## Summary

Reorganized documentation structure to better reflect project status and maintain clarity between current, completed, and historical work.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Directories

- `/doc/completed/` - For completed implementation work
- `/doc/archive/` - For historical/superseded documentation

### 2. Moved Documents

#### From `/doc/progress/` to `/doc/completed/`
All progress documents were completed work:
- `ddd-compliance-100-percent-complete.md`
- `ddd-compliance-current-code-assessment.md`
- `ddd-compliance-reassessment.md`
- `design-compliance-summary.md`
- `fresh-start-ddd-implementation.md`
- `graph-components.md`
- `plan-ddd-compliance-update.md`
- `plan-updated-for-incremental-development.md`

#### From `/doc/plan/` to `/doc/archive/`
Original planning documents (contain old naming conventions):
- `01-requirements-overview.md`
- `02-domain-model.md`
- `03-technical-architecture.md`
- `04-user-stories.md`
- `05-non-functional-requirements.md`
- `06-implementation-phases.md`

### 3. Current Structure

```
doc/
├── archive/          # Historical documents (DO NOT USE for reference)
├── completed/        # Completed work documentation
├── design/          # Current design documents (DDD-compliant)
├── plan/            # Active planning documents
├── progress/        # Current work in progress (currently empty)
├── publish/         # Published documentation
└── research/        # Background research
```

## Rationale

- **Clarity**: Clear separation between current, completed, and historical work
- **Focus**: Progress folder only contains active work
- **Safety**: Archived documents clearly marked as outdated
- **Reference**: Completed work preserved for lessons learned

## Going Forward

1. Start new progress documents when beginning implementation
2. Move to completed when work is done
3. Archive documents when they become obsolete
4. Keep active directories clean and current
