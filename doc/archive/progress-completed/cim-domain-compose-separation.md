# CIM Domain vs CIM Compose Separation - Progress

## Status: COMPLETE

## Work Completed

### 1. Clarified Responsibilities
- Created design document: `/doc/design/cim-domain-compose-separation.md`
- Defined clear separation:
  - **cim-domain**: Core DDD building blocks (Entity, Aggregate, ValueObject)
  - **cim-compose**: Graph composition of those building blocks

### 2. Fixed Dependency Direction
- **Before**: Unclear dependencies, duplicated types
- **After**: Clean dependency flow:
  ```
  cim-domain → domain modules → cim-compose
  ```
- Domain modules (document, graph, person) depend ONLY on cim-domain
- cim-compose depends on domain modules (feature-gated)

### 3. Updated Dependencies
- Added `cim-domain` as dependency to `cim-compose` in Cargo.toml
- Added domain modules as optional dependencies in cim-compose:
  - cim-domain-document
  - cim-domain-graph
  - cim-domain-person
  - cim-domain-workflow
  - cim-domain-location
  - cim-domain-agent
  - cim-domain-organization

### 4. Removed Duplicate Types
- Removed duplicate `Entity<T>` definition from cim-compose
- Removed duplicate `EntityId<T>` definition from cim-compose
- Removed duplicate marker types from cim-compose
- Now importing all these from cim-domain

### 5. Updated Imports
- Updated `cim-compose/src/base_types.rs` to import from cim-domain
- Updated `cim-compose/src/lib.rs` documentation
- Created proper re-exports for convenience

### 6. Created Domain Compositions Module
- Added `domain_compositions.rs` in cim-compose
- Implements `Composable` trait for all domain aggregates:
  - Document → GraphComposition
  - ConceptGraph → GraphComposition (with NodeId mapping)
  - Person → GraphComposition
  - WorkflowAggregate → GraphComposition
  - Location → GraphComposition
  - Agent → GraphComposition
  - Organization → GraphComposition
- Created helper functions for common patterns:
  - `create_processing_pipeline()` for documents
  - `create_agent_network()` for agents
  - `create_org_hierarchy()` for organizations

### 7. Fixed Type Mismatches
- Resolved NodeId type mismatch between cim-domain and cim-compose
- Added proper mapping between domain NodeIds and local NodeIds
- Used `add_node_with_id` for preserving node relationships

### 8. Created Examples
- Updated `compose_domains.rs` example showing correct architecture
- Example demonstrates all 7 domains can be composed
- Shows feature-gated compilation

### 9. Verified Compilation
- All domain modules compile independently
- cim-compose compiles with all domain features enabled
- Example runs successfully showing composition capabilities

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Domain modules focus on business logic
   - cim-compose focuses on composition patterns

2. **No Circular Dependencies**
   - Clean dependency flow from core → domains → compose

3. **Extensibility**
   - New domains can be added without modifying existing code
   - Feature flags allow selective compilation

4. **Type Safety**
   - No duplicate type definitions
   - Proper type conversions where needed

5. **Reusability**
   - Domain modules can be used independently
   - Composition patterns can be applied to any domain

## Files Modified

- `/cim-compose/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies
- `/cim-compose/src/base_types.rs` - Removed duplicates, added imports
- `/cim-compose/src/lib.rs` - Updated documentation
- `/cim-compose/src/domain_compositions.rs` - Created new module
- `/cim-compose/src/mapping.rs` - Fixed missing match arms
- `/cim-compose/examples/compose_domains.rs` - Created example
- `/cim-domain-graph/Cargo.toml` - Removed cim-compose dependency
- `/cim-domain-document/Cargo.toml` - Removed cim-compose dependency
- `/doc/design/cim-domain-compose-separation.md` - Design document
- `/doc/plan/fix-cim-domain-compose-separation.md` - Implementation plan

## Next Steps

1. Extract remaining domains if any exist
2. Create integration tests for cross-domain compositions
3. Add more examples showing complex composition patterns
4. Consider implementing Decomposable trait for reverse transformations
5. Document the composition patterns in user guide
