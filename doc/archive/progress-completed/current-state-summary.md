# Current State Summary - January 8, 2025

## Overview

The Information Alchemist project has successfully completed Phase 2 (ACT Structures Implementation) and begun Phase 3 (Visualization and UI Integration). All compilation errors have been fixed, and all 176 library tests are now passing.

## Major Achievements

### Compilation and Testing
- **All 10 compilation errors fixed** - The main application now compiles cleanly
- **All 176 library tests passing** - Fixed the last 3 failing tests:
  - Cosine distance calculation for zero values
  - Y-plane constraint test with proper time initialization
  - Spring forces test checking velocities instead of positions
- **Integration tests need updating** - Many integration tests still use outdated APIs

### Phase 2 Completion: ACT Structures
- **ConceptGraph Base Implementation** - Core types for graph-based domain modeling
- **ContextBridge** - Cross-context relationships with 7 DDD mapping patterns
- **MetricContext** - Measurable relationships and semantic distances
- **RuleContext** - Business logic and reasoning with rule engines
- **Applied Category Theory Integration** - All Seven Sketches concepts mapped to implementation

### Phase 3 Progress: Visualization
- **ConceptualNodeVisual** - 3D visualization components for concepts
- **ConceptualEdgeVisual** - Relationship visualization with styles
- **QualityDimensionAxis** - 3D representation of quality dimensions
- **ConceptualSpaceVisual** - Grid and bounds for conceptual spaces
- **Working Demo** - Visual example showing concepts in 3D quality space

## Current Architecture

### Domain Layer
- Graph, Workflow, and ConceptGraph aggregates fully implemented
- Comprehensive command and event handling
- Value objects with proper DDD immutability patterns
- Business rules and invariants enforced

### Application Layer
- Command handlers for all domain operations
- Read model projections (GraphSummaryProjection)
- External system projection framework (bidirectional)
- Event-driven architecture with NATS JetStream

### Infrastructure Layer
- NATS integration with JetStream event store
- CID-chained events for integrity
- Object store for content-addressed storage
- Subject-based routing with event sequencing

### Presentation Layer
- Bevy ECS for real-time 3D visualization
- Force-directed graph layout
- Subgraph visualization with boundaries
- Camera controls and interactive features
- Event-driven animations

## Technical Debt

### Integration Tests
- Many tests still use outdated APIs and need updating
- Test coverage below 80% target (currently ~65%)
- Missing tests for new ACT structures

### Documentation
- Some documentation still references old architecture
- Need user guide for ConceptGraph features
- API documentation for new ACT structures needed

### Performance
- No performance testing for large graphs yet
- Optimization needed for 100K+ node graphs
- Memory usage not yet profiled

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Continuation)

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Interactive Graph Manipulation**
   - Implement dragging for ConceptualNodeVisual
   - Add connection creation between concepts
   - Support for editing quality dimensions

2. **Context Bridge Visualization**
   - Visual representation of context mappings
   - Interactive bridge creation and editing
   - Translation rule visualization

3. **Domain Model Importers**
   - Import existing DDD models as ConceptGraphs
   - Support for various diagram formats
   - Automatic quality dimension inference

4. **Workflow Engine Visualization**
   - Visual workflow design using ConceptGraphs
   - Step execution visualization
   - State machine representation

### Week 3 Goals
- Complete interactive manipulation features
- Implement at least 2 domain model importers
- Create comprehensive demos for all ACT structures
- Update integration tests to new APIs

## Project Status

- **Phase 0**: ‚úÖ Complete - NATS Integration
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Complete - Distributed Event Infrastructure
- **Phase 1.5**: ‚úÖ Complete - IPLD Integration
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Complete - ACT Structures Implementation
- **Phase 3**: üöß In Progress - Visualization and UI Integration (Week 1 of 2)
- **Phase 4**: ‚è≥ Pending - Conceptual Space Integration
- **Phase 5**: ‚è≥ Pending - AI Agent Integration
- **Phase 6**: ‚è≥ Pending - Dog-fooding & Polish

## Key Metrics

- **Tests**: 176 passing, 0 failing
- **Code Coverage**: ~65% (target: 80%)
- **Compilation**: Clean, no errors or critical warnings
- **Performance**: Not yet measured
- **Lines of Code**: ~50,000+ (excluding dependencies)

## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress with the completion of Phase 2 and the beginning of Phase 3. The core domain model based on Applied Category Theory is now fully implemented, and visualization work has begun. With all compilation errors fixed and tests passing, the foundation is solid for rapid progress on the visualization and interaction features that will make the ConceptGraph system usable for real-world domain modeling.
