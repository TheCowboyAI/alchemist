# ContextGraph Standalone Refactoring Complete

## Date: 2025-01-11

## Summary
Successfully refactored `cim-contextgraph` to be a pure, standalone graph theory implementation without domain-specific dependencies. This refactoring improves modularity and allows the graph module to be used by any domain without coupling.

## What Was Done

### 1. Identified Domain-Specific Code
- `workflow_graph.rs` - Contains workflow domain logic and imports from `cim_domain`
- `cid_dag.rs` - Implements content-addressed DAG functionality specific to IPLD

### 2. Created New Modules
- **cim-workflow-graph**: Composition of context graphs with workflow domain
  - Moved `workflow_graph.rs` here
  - Added proper dependencies: `cim-contextgraph`, `cim-domain`, `cim-domain-workflow`
  - Added missing types: `WorkflowType`, `EnrichmentType`, `EnrichmentValue` trait

- **cim-ipld-graph**: Composition of context graphs with IPLD/CID
  - Moved `cid_dag.rs` here
  - Added proper dependencies: `cim-contextgraph`, `cim-ipld`, `daggy`, `cid`
  - Created `CidDagError` type for CID-specific errors

### 3. Cleaned Up cim-contextgraph
- Removed `cid` and `daggy` dependencies
- Removed exports of moved types
- Removed CID-related error variants from `GraphError`
- Module now contains only pure graph abstractions

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- Added new modules to workspace members in root `Cargo.toml`
- Updated `examples/approval_workflow.rs` to use `cim-workflow-graph`
- Fixed all compilation errors

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between pure graph theory and domain-specific compositions
2. **Reusability**: `cim-contextgraph` can now be used by any domain without pulling in unnecessary dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Each module has focused responsibilities and appropriate dependencies
4. **Testability**: Can test graph logic independently of domain logic
5. **Composability**: Other modules can compose graphs with their specific domains

## Module Structure After Refactoring

```
cim-contextgraph/           # Pure graph abstractions
├── context_graph.rs        # Core graph implementation
├── types.rs               # Generic graph types
├── invariants.rs          # Graph invariants
├── composition.rs         # Graph composition operations
└── lib.rs                 # Module exports

cim-workflow-graph/         # Workflow + Graph composition
└── lib.rs                 # WorkflowGraph implementation

cim-ipld-graph/            # IPLD + Graph composition
└── lib.rs                 # CidDag implementation
```

## Next Steps
1. Document the new module structure and composition patterns
2. Create examples showing how to compose graphs with different domains
3. Consider creating more domain-specific graph compositions as needed
