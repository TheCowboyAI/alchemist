# All Domain Tests Fixed - Summary

## Date: 2025-01-12

## Overview
Successfully fixed all failing tests across all domain modules in the CIM project. This completes a major milestone in the test gap remediation plan.

## Domains Fixed

### 1. Identity Domain (cim-domain-identity)
- **Status**: ✅ All 35 tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Aligned test expectations with actual API (no `metadata` field, specific fields instead)
  - Fixed command field names (e.g., `phone_number` instead of `new_phone`)
  - Updated event names (PersonRegistered instead of PersonCreated)
  - Fixed validation error types

### 2. Agent Domain (cim-domain-agent)
- **Status**: ✅ Already passing
- **Tests**: All tests were already aligned with implementation

### 3. Policy Domain (cim-domain-policy)
- **Status**: ✅ 27 tests passing
- **Tests**: All tests were already aligned with implementation

### 4. Graph Domain (cim-domain-graph)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Fixed import paths in projection modules
  - Changed `super::GraphProjection` to `crate::projections::GraphProjection`

### 5. Workflow Domain (cim-domain-workflow)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Removed usage of non-existent `as_any()` method on DomainEvent trait
  - Fixed unused imports and variables
  - Updated test assertions to check event types instead of downcasting

### 6. Document Domain (cim-domain-document)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Added missing AggregateRoot trait import
  - Fixed EntityId import path

### 7. Location Domain (cim-domain-location)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Fixed event handler tests (removed as_any() usage)
  - Updated imports to use correct module paths

### 8. Person Domain (cim-domain-person)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Tests**: Already aligned with implementation

### 9. Organization Domain (cim-domain-organization)
- **Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Updated test code to use public fields instead of getter methods
  - Fixed member addition test to match actual API

## Common Patterns Fixed

1. **DomainEvent Trait Issues**:
   - The `DomainEvent` trait doesn't have an `as_any()` method
   - Tests were updated to verify event types instead of downcasting

2. **Import Path Issues**:
   - Fixed module imports to use correct paths
   - Added missing trait imports (especially AggregateRoot)

3. **API Mismatches**:
   - Tests were written against assumed APIs that didn't match implementation
   - Fixed by aligning tests with actual public APIs

4. **Field Access**:
   - Some domains use public fields, others use getter methods
   - Tests updated to match each domain's approach

## Next Steps

With all domain tests passing, we can now proceed to:
1. Integration tests between domains
2. NATS messaging tests
3. Bevy ECS integration tests
4. End-to-end workflow tests

## Test Statistics

Total domain tests passing: ~200+ tests across all domains
- Identity: 35 tests
- Policy: 27 tests
- Other domains: Various counts

All tests are now green, providing a solid foundation for further development.
