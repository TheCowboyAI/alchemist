# Person Domain Extraction Complete

## Summary

Successfully extracted the person domain from `cim-domain` into its own submodule `cim-domain-person`.

## What Was Extracted

### From cim-domain to cim-domain-person:

1. **Core Person Module** (`person.rs`)
   - Person aggregate with marker
   - All person-related components:
     - IdentityComponent
     - ContactComponent (with EmailAddress, PhoneNumber, Address)
     - EmploymentComponent
     - PositionComponent
     - SkillsComponent
     - AccessComponent
     - ExternalIdentifiersComponent
     - ComponentMetadata

2. **Person Commands**
   - RegisterPerson
   - UpdatePersonProfile
   - PersonComponentUpdates

3. **Person Events**
   - PersonRegistered

4. **Person Command Handlers**
   - PersonCommandHandler

5. **Person Query Handlers**
   - PersonView
   - GetPersonById
   - FindPeopleByOrganization
   - PersonQueryHandler

6. **Person State Machine**
   - PersonState enum
   - PersonTransitionInput enum
   - State machine implementations

7. **Bevy Bridge Components**
   - map_person() method
   - Person-related translation logic

## What Remains in cim-domain

Common/shared functionality that other domains use:
- Base traits (AggregateRoot, Component, etc.)
- CQRS infrastructure
- Event sourcing base types
- State machine framework
- Common error types
- Entity ID system

## Repository Structure

- **cim-domain-person**: https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/cim-domain-person
  - Standalone person domain with its own Cargo.toml
  - Dependencies on cim-core-domain for base traits
  - Can be used independently

## Build Status

✅ All tests passing
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Person domain properly isolated

## Next Steps

The same extraction pattern can be applied to:
- cim-domain-organization
- cim-domain-agent
- cim-domain-policy
- cim-domain-document
- cim-domain-workflow

Each will become its own bounded context submodule with clear boundaries and event-based communication.
