# Graph Domain Extraction Complete

## Summary

Successfully extracted the graph domain from `cim-domain` into `cim-domain-graph` submodule.

## What Was Extracted

### From cim-domain:
- `concept_graph.rs` → `cim-domain-graph/src/aggregate/concept_graph.rs`
- `domain_graph.rs` → `cim-domain-graph/src/aggregate/domain_graph.rs`
- Graph events (GraphCreated, NodeAdded, NodeRemoved, NodeUpdated, EdgeAdded, EdgeRemoved)
- Graph projections (GraphSummaryProjection, NodeListProjection)
- `generate_domain_graph` binary

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Core Composition Layer**: cim-domain-graph serves as the composition layer for CIM. Other domains can be composed into graphs but do not depend on the graph domain.

2. **Temporary Dependencies**: Currently depends on cim-domain for:
   - GraphId (should eventually move to cim-core-domain)
   - Component and ComponentStorage
   - DomainEvent trait
   - Projection trait

3. **GraphProjection Trait**: Created a new trait for graph-specific projections that extends the base functionality.

4. **Event Structure**: Maintained graph events with proper DomainEvent implementations and created GraphDomainEvent enum wrapper.

## Compilation Status

✅ cim-domain-graph builds successfully
✅ cim-domain builds successfully (graph code removed)

## Tests Status

- Basic test structure in place
- Tests need to be run to verify functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Extract remaining domains**:
   - Person domain
   - Organization domain
   - Agent domain
   - Policy domain
   - Document domain

2. **Move shared identifiers**: GraphId should eventually move to cim-core-domain

3. **Implement missing components**:
   - Graph commands
   - Graph command handlers
   - Graph queries
   - Graph value objects

4. **Integration testing**: Test that domains can compose objects into graphs without depending on graph domain

## Git Status

- Initialized as git repository
- Added as submodule: https://github.com/thecowboyai/cim-domain-graph
- Initial commit completed

## Notes

The graph domain is now properly isolated as the composition layer for CIM. Other domains can have their objects composed into graphs without creating dependencies on the graph domain itself, maintaining clean separation of concerns.
