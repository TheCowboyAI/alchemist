# Migration Summary: Legacy to Event Sourcing

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration from the legacy graph editor implementation to the new Event Sourcing architecture.

## What Was Archived

### Source Code
- Complete `/src` directory with all bounded contexts
- 8 bounded contexts: graph_management, visualization, selection, layout, import_export, event_store, collaboration, analysis
- Fully functional graph editor with all features implemented

### Documentation
- All design documents (22 files)
- All plan documents (18 files)
- All progress tracking documents
- Test results and QA reports

### Key Features Preserved
1. **Graph Management** - CRUD operations on graphs
2. **3D Visualization** - Bevy-based rendering
3. **Selection System** - Multi-select with keyboard modifiers
4. **Layout Algorithms** - Force-directed positioning
5. **Import/Export** - JSON and Mermaid MD formats
6. **Storage Layer** - Daggy/Petgraph based
7. **Event System** - Domain events with DDD naming
8. **UI/Shortcuts** - Complete keyboard and mouse controls

## Why We Migrated

### Limitations of Legacy Architecture
- Direct mutations made it hard to track changes
- No audit trail or undo/redo capability
- Limited to ~10K nodes
- Tight coupling between layers
- Difficult to add time-travel features

### Benefits of Event Sourcing
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Natural undo/redo through event replay
- Time-travel debugging
- Better performance potential (100K+ nodes)
- Clean separation of concerns
- CQRS for optimized queries

## New Architecture Highlights

### Core Principles
1. **Event Sourcing** - All changes as immutable events
2. **CQRS Light** - Separated read and write models
3. **Domain/ECS Separation** - Persistent vs ephemeral events
4. **Local-First** - No distributed complexity initially
5. **Performance Focus** - Built for 100K+ nodes

### Technical Stack
- **Rust** with 2024 edition
- **Bevy 0.16** for visualization
- **Petgraph** for graph algorithms
- **Event Store** with JSON persistence
- **DDD** principles throughout

### Architecture Layers
```
Application (Commands, Queries, UI Events)
    ↓
Domain (Graph Aggregate, Event Store, Read Model)
    ↓
Infrastructure (Petgraph, File Storage, Bevy ECS)
```

## Migration Status

### Completed
- [x] Legacy system archived
- [x] New architecture designed
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [x] Project structure set up
- [x] Dependencies configured
- [x] Progress tracking established

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: Core Event Infrastructure (0%)

### Upcoming
- [ ] Phase 2: Graph Aggregate with Petgraph
- [ ] Phase 3: Read Model and Queries
- [ ] Phase 4: Bevy Integration
- [ ] Phase 5: Feature Migration
- [ ] Phase 6: Performance and Polish

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Start Fresh** - Clean implementation rather than gradual refactor
2. **Local Event Store** - Simple JSON persistence initially
3. **Sync API First** - Async can be added later if needed
4. **Petgraph** - For efficient graph algorithms
5. **No NATS Initially** - Avoid distributed system complexity

## Lessons from Legacy

### What Worked Well
- DDD naming conventions
- Bounded context separation
- Event-driven communication
- Bevy ECS for visualization
- Comprehensive test suite

### What We're Improving
- Event sourcing for full history
- CQRS for better query performance
- Cleaner aggregate boundaries
- Better performance architecture
- More maintainable code structure

## Resources

### Legacy Documentation
- Feature set: `FEATURE-SET.md`
- All source code preserved
- Design and plan documents

### New Documentation
- Architecture: `/doc/design/event-sourced-graph-architecture.md`
- Plan: `/doc/plan/event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md`
- Progress: `/doc/progress/`

## Timeline

- **Legacy Development**: Unknown - December 2024
- **Migration Started**: December 2024
- **Estimated Completion**: 6 weeks (February 2025)

## Success Metrics

### Must Have
- Feature parity with legacy system
- All tests passing
- Clean architecture
- Comprehensive documentation

### Nice to Have
- 100K+ node performance
- Sub-10ms query latency
- Advanced time-travel features
- Collaborative editing preparation
