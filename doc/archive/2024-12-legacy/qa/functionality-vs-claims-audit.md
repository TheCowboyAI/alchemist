# Functionality vs Claims Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The project claims extensive functionality that does not exist. The README advertises a "powerful 3D-capable graph visualization and editing system" with numerous advanced features, but the actual implementation is a basic proof-of-concept with hardcoded test data and minimal functionality.

## Claimed vs Actual Functionality

### ❌ 3D/2D Visualization
- **Claimed**: "Seamlessly switch between immersive 3D exploration and efficient 2D overview modes"
- **Actual**: Only 3D mode exists, no 2D mode, no switching capability

### ❌ Subgraph Composition
- **Claimed**: "Load and compose multiple graphs while maintaining their structure as distinct subgraphs"
- **Actual**: Can only load one hardcoded graph, no composition features

### ❌ Real-time Collaboration
- **Claimed**: "Multiple users can work on the same graph simultaneously"
- **Actual**: No networking, no multi-user support, no collaboration features

### ❌ AI-Powered Insights
- **Claimed**: "Integrated AI agents provide pattern recognition and optimization suggestions"
- **Actual**: No AI integration whatsoever

### ❌ Event-Driven Architecture
- **Claimed**: "Every change is captured as an event, enabling perfect audit trails"
- **Actual**: Basic Bevy events exist but no audit trail or event sourcing

### ❌ High Performance
- **Claimed**: "Handles 250k+ elements at 60 FPS through advanced rendering optimizations"
- **Actual**: No performance optimizations, no testing with large graphs

### ❌ Extensible/WASM Plugins
- **Claimed**: "WASM-based plugin system for custom algorithms and visualizations"
- **Actual**: No plugin system, no WASM support

### ⚠️ Import/Export (Partially Implemented)
- **Claimed**: Full import/export capability
- **Actual**:
  - Import only works from hardcoded path (assets/models/CIM.json)
  - Export exists (Ctrl+S) but untested
  - No round-trip verification

### ✅ Basic Features That DO Exist
1. Basic graph rendering with nodes and edges
2. Camera controls (rotate, zoom)
3. Force-directed layout (press L)
4. Node visualization styles (Ctrl+1-4)
5. Basic selection system
6. Export to JSON (but limited testing)

## Missing Test Coverage

### Critical Missing Tests

1. **Feature Existence Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_2d_3d_mode_switching() {
       // This test would FAIL - feature doesn't exist
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_subgraph_composition() {
       // This test would FAIL - feature doesn't exist
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_multi_user_collaboration() {
       // This test would FAIL - feature doesn't exist
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_ai_agent_integration() {
       // This test would FAIL - feature doesn't exist
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_wasm_plugin_loading() {
       // This test would FAIL - feature doesn't exist
   }
   ```

2. **Performance Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_render_250k_elements_at_60fps() {
       // This test would FAIL - no performance optimizations
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_complete_user_workflow() {
       // Load graph, edit it, save it, reload it
       // Would expose multiple issues
   }
   ```

4. **Round-trip Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_import_export_round_trip() {
       // Save a graph, load it back, verify identical
       // Currently untested
   }
   ```

## Why Tests Are Passing

The existing tests only cover the small pieces that ARE implemented:
- Unit tests for individual components (nodes, edges, positions)
- Basic ECS system tests
- Simple domain model tests

They DON'T test:
- End-to-end user workflows
- The claimed features that don't exist
- Performance requirements
- Integration between systems
- File I/O beyond basic serialization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove false claims from README
   - Create accurate feature list
   - Mark planned features as "TODO"

2. **Add Failing Tests**
   - Write tests for ALL claimed features
   - These should FAIL until features are implemented
   - Use test-driven development going forward

3. **Create Honest Roadmap**
   - List what actually exists
   - Prioritize missing features
   - Set realistic timelines

### Test Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Expose current gaps)
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Import/export round-trip tests
   - Multi-graph handling tests
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Medium Priority** (Guide development)
   - 2D/3D mode switching tests
   - Subgraph composition tests
   - Plugin system tests

3. **Low Priority** (Future features)
   - Collaboration tests
   - AI integration tests
   - Advanced visualization tests

## Conclusion

The project is at an early proof-of-concept stage, not a complete system. The test suite gives a false sense of completeness by only testing the implemented fragments rather than the advertised functionality.

**Recommendation**: Adopt strict TDD practices and write failing tests for all claimed features before any further development.

## Compliance Issues

### Rule Violations
1. **TDD Violation**: Features implemented without tests
2. **Documentation Mismatch**: Claims don't match reality
3. **Test Coverage**: No integration or performance tests

### Next Steps
1. Create `/doc/plan/add-missing-test-coverage.md`
2. Update `/doc/progress/README.md` with accurate status
3. Fix README.md to reflect actual functionality
