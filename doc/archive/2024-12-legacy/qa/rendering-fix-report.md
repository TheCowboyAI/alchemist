# Rendering Fix Report - Information Alchemist

## Issue
The application was "half rendering" - entities were being created but not visible in the 3D scene.

## Root Cause
The visualization systems were creating mesh components for nodes and edges but were missing the required `Visibility` component. This caused Bevy's rendering pipeline to skip these entities, resulting in:
- Visibility hierarchy warnings in the console
- Entities existing in the ECS but not being rendered

## Solution
Added `Visibility::default()` component to all rendered entities:

1. **Node Rendering** - Updated `render_node` function to add visibility for all render modes:
   - Mesh mode
   - Point cloud mode
   - Wireframe mode
   - Billboard mode

2. **Edge Rendering** - Updated all edge rendering functions:
   - `render_line_edge` - Added visibility to line edges
   - `render_cylinder_edge` - Added visibility to cylinder edges
   - `render_arc_edge` - Added visibility to arc parent entity
   - `render_bezier_edge` - Added visibility to bezier parent entity

3. **Flow Particles** - Added visibility to edge flow particles

## Technical Details
Bevy's rendering system requires entities with mesh components to also have:
- `Visibility` - Controls whether the entity should be rendered
- `InheritedVisibility` - Automatically added by Bevy when Visibility is present
- `ViewVisibility` - Automatically computed by Bevy

The `#[require(InheritedVisibility, ViewVisibility)]` attribute on the `Visibility` component ensures all three are properly set up.

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- No more visibility hierarchy warnings
- Graph nodes render as blue spheres in a circular arrangement
- Edges render as cylinders connecting the nodes
- All 8 nodes and 14 edges are visible
- Camera controls work (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom)

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/visualization/services.rs` - Added Visibility components to all rendering functions

## Status
âœ… Fixed - The application now renders the graph correctly with all nodes and edges visible.
