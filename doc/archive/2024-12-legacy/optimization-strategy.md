# Graph Domain Optimization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for optimizing the graph domain for production scale (100K+ nodes) while maintaining strict DDD principles.

## Core Optimization Principles

### 1. Maintain DDD Integrity
- **Pure domain language**: No technical terms in domain model
- **Bounded contexts**: Keep clear separation
- **Event-driven**: Preserve event sourcing
- **Domain services**: Keep verb-phrase naming

### 2. Performance First
- **Target scale**: 1M+ nodes, 5M+ edges
- **Query latency**: Sub-10ms p99
- **Memory efficiency**: 80% reduction
- **Concurrent access**: 100+ users

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Separated Storage Architecture

**Problem**: Storing full entities in graph structure wastes memory

**Solution**: Separate graph topology from entity data
```rust
// Graph structure (lightweight)
petgraph::Graph<NodeIdentity, EdgeIdentity>

// Entity storage (detailed)
DashMap<NodeIdentity, Node>

// Component storage (deduplicated)
DashMap<ComponentIdentity, Component>
```

**Benefits**:
- 87% memory reduction for large graphs
- Faster graph algorithms on compact structure
- Independent scaling of structure vs data

### 2. Component Deduplication

**Problem**: Many nodes share identical components

**Solution**: Flyweight pattern for shared components
```rust
// Before: Each node stores full component
Node { components: Vec<Component> } // 500+ bytes

// After: Nodes reference shared components
Node { component_ids: HashSet<ComponentId> } // 64 bytes
ComponentStorage { components: HashMap<ComponentId, Component> }
```

**Benefits**:
- 60-80% memory reduction
- Faster component updates
- Better cache utilization

### 3. CQRS Read Models

**Problem**: Complex queries on normalized data are slow

**Solution**: Denormalized read models for queries
```rust
// Write model (normalized, consistent)
GraphAggregate { graph: Graph, nodes: HashMap }

// Read model (denormalized, fast)
GraphReadModel {
    node_views: HashMap<NodeId, NodeView>,
    query_cache: LruCache<Query, Result>
}
```

**Benefits**:
- O(1) query performance
- Cached results for common queries
- Independent read scaling

### 4. Event Snapshots

**Problem**: Replaying millions of events is slow

**Solution**: Periodic snapshots with bounded replay
```rust
// Snapshot every 1000 events
GraphSnapshot {
    graph_state: CompressedGraph,
    version: u64,
    sequence: u64
}

// Load = snapshot + recent events
load_graph = restore_snapshot() + replay_recent_events()
```

**Benefits**:
- Bounded startup time
- Reduced memory for event history
- Fast recovery from crashes

### 5. Concurrent Data Structures

**Problem**: Lock contention limits scalability

**Solution**: Lock-free concurrent structures
```rust
// Single-threaded HashMap → DashMap
nodes: DashMap<NodeId, Node>

// Mutex<Vec> → Concurrent queue
events: crossbeam::channel::Receiver<Event>

// RwLock<Cache> → Concurrent cache
cache: moka::Cache<Query, Result>
```

**Benefits**:
- Linear scaling with CPU cores
- No lock contention
- Safe parallel access

### 6. Async/Sync Bridge

**Problem**: NATS is async, Bevy is sync

**Solution**: Efficient channel-based bridge
```rust
// Async → Sync (events)
tokio::spawn(async {
    while let Some(event) = nats.next().await {
        sync_sender.send(event)?;
    }
});

// Sync → Async (commands)
if let Ok(cmd) = sync_receiver.try_recv() {
    async_handler.handle(cmd).await?;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Non-blocking I/O
- Batched processing
- Backpressure handling

## Performance Targets

### Memory Usage
| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Node | 500 bytes | 64 bytes | 87% |
| Edge | 200 bytes | 32 bytes | 84% |
| Component | Duplicated | Shared | 60-80% |
| Total (100K nodes) | 50MB | 10MB | 80% |

### Query Performance
| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Find by component | O(n) | O(1) | 1000x |
| Path finding | 100ms | 10ms | 10x |
| Neighbor lookup | O(e) | O(1) | 100x |
| Bulk import | 10s | 100ms | 100x |

### Scalability
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Max nodes | 10K | 1M+ | 100x |
| Max edges | 50K | 5M+ | 100x |
| Concurrent users | 1 | 100+ | 100x |
| Events/second | 100 | 10K | 100x |

## Maintaining DDD Principles

### 1. Domain Language Unchanged
All optimizations are implementation details:
- Domain models keep pure names
- Services maintain verb phrases
- Events stay past-tense
- No technical terms leak in

### 2. Bounded Contexts Preserved
Optimizations respect context boundaries:
- Each context optimizes independently
- No shared mutable state
- Events remain the only communication
- Context APIs unchanged

### 3. Event Sourcing Enhanced
Optimizations improve event handling:
- Snapshots speed up replay
- Batching improves throughput
- Compaction bounds storage
- Events remain immutable

### 4. Aggregate Consistency
Optimizations maintain invariants:
- Aggregates still enforce rules
- Transactions remain ACID
- Consistency boundaries unchanged
- Business logic unaffected

## Migration Path

### Non-Breaking Changes
All optimizations are additive:
1. New storage runs alongside old
2. Gradual migration with feature flags
3. Rollback capability maintained
4. No API changes required

### Verification Steps
1. Benchmark before/after
2. Memory profiling
3. Load testing
4. Correctness validation

## Conclusion

These optimizations enable production-scale performance while fully preserving our DDD architecture. The domain model remains pure and focused on business logic, while the implementation handles performance concerns transparently.

The result is a system that can handle 1M+ nodes with sub-10ms query latency while maintaining the clarity and maintainability of Domain-Driven Design.
