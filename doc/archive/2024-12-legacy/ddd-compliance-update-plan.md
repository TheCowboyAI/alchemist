# DDD Compliance Achievement and Maintenance Plan

## Status: ✅ 100% DDD Compliance Achieved

We have successfully updated all code and documentation to comply with DDD naming conventions that enforce pure domain language without technical suffixes.

## What We Achieved

### ✅ Phase 1: Design Documentation - COMPLETE
- Consolidated into 3 clean DDD-compliant documents
- Removed 9+ deprecated documents with violations
- Created clear design guidance

### ✅ Phase 2: Code Implementation - COMPLETE
- All events renamed (no "Event" suffix)
- Services use verb phrases (CreateGraph, AnimateGraphElements)
- Storage uses plural terms (Graphs, Nodes, Edges)
- No technical suffixes anywhere

### ✅ Phase 3: Fresh Start Success
Instead of refactoring, we:
- Started fresh with clean architecture
- Built DDD-compliant from day one
- Achieved working 3D visualization
- Maintained 100% compliance throughout

## Current DDD-Compliant State

### Events (Past-Tense Facts)
```rust
// ✅ Correct - What we use
GraphCreated
NodeAdded
EdgeConnected
NodeMoved
PropertyUpdated

// ❌ Incorrect - What we avoid
GraphCreatedEvent
NodeAddedEvent
EdgeCreatedEvent
```

### Services (Verb Phrases)
```rust
// ✅ Correct - What we use
CreateGraph
AddNodeToGraph
ConnectGraphNodes
AnimateGraphElements
RenderGraphElements

// ❌ Incorrect - What we avoid
GraphManager
GraphService
NodeSystem
LayoutEngine
```

### Storage (Plural Terms)
```rust
// ✅ Correct - What we use
Graphs
GraphEvents
Nodes
Edges

// ❌ Incorrect - What we avoid
GraphRepository
NodeStorage
EdgeRepo
GraphStore
```

## Maintaining Compliance Going Forward

### 1. Code Review Checklist
Before approving any PR:
- [ ] Events are past-tense without suffix
- [ ] Services are verb phrases
- [ ] Storage uses plural terms
- [ ] No Manager, Handler, Engine, System suffixes
- [ ] Components have domain-specific names

### 2. New Feature Guidelines
When adding features:
1. Define the domain event first (past-tense fact)
2. Create service with verb phrase name
3. Use existing patterns as reference
4. Update vocabulary.md with new terms

### 3. Testing for Compliance
```rust
// Example compliance test
#[test]
fn events_follow_naming_convention() {
    // Verify no "Event" suffix in type names
    assert!(!type_name::<GraphCreated>().contains("Event"));
}
```

### 4. Documentation Standards
- Always use DDD-compliant names in docs
- Reference `/doc/design/` for patterns
- Keep vocabulary.md updated
- Use domain language in comments

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Knowledge Graph Ready**: Component names can be extracted
2. **Self-Documenting**: Names reveal intent
3. **Consistency**: Same patterns everywhere
4. **No Technical Debt**: Clean from the start
5. **Team Alignment**: Shared vocabulary

## Quick Reference

### When Creating New Code

| Creating | Use Pattern | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Event | Past-tense fact | `NodeSelected` |
| Service | Verb phrase | `SelectNode` |
| Storage | Plural noun | `SelectedNodes` |
| Component | Domain term | `SelectionHighlight` |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Adding "Event" to events
- ❌ Using "Manager" or "Service" in names
- ❌ Technical terms like "Engine", "System"
- ❌ Generic names like "Handler", "Processor"
- ❌ Abbreviations instead of clear names

## Conclusion

DDD compliance is not a one-time task but an ongoing practice. With our clean foundation, maintaining compliance is straightforward - just follow the established patterns.

**Remember**: When in doubt, refer to existing code in `/src` as the reference implementation.
