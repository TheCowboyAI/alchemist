# Immediate Action Plan

## Current Situation

After reconciling our documentation, we've discovered:
1. **All core phases (1-6) are complete** - The project has more functionality than some docs suggested
2. ✅ **Test compilation is fixed** - Updated to Bevy main branch, tests now compile
3. **Documentation is being cleaned up** - Progress tracking is being reconciled

## ✅ Test Infrastructure Fixed

### Solution Implemented
Updated Bevy dependencies to main branch, which resolved the experimental occlusion culling linking errors.

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Updated Bevy to git main branch
2. ✅ Removed unused egui dependencies
3. ✅ Ran `nix flake check` - successful
4. ✅ Tests compile with BEVY_HEADLESS=1

### Test Inventory Created
Created comprehensive test inventory document (`test-inventory-by-domain.md`) showing:
- 114 total tests
- 105 passing
- 0 failing (compilation fixed)
- 9 ignored (need fixes)

## Next Steps

### 1. Documentation Cleanup (1 day)
- [x] Move outdated phase-5-import-export-status.md to archive
- [x] Create test inventory by domain
- [ ] Consolidate all completed phase documents
- [ ] Update main README with current status
- [ ] Create user guide for all implemented features

### 2. Fix Ignored Tests (2-3 days)
Priority order:
1. **Event Store Integration** (5 tests)
   - Fix event adapter integration
   - Update replay system
   - Fix plugin initialization

2. **Selection Animation** (3 tests)
   - Fix transform integration
   - Update box selection with scales
   - Fix highlight storage

3. **Visualization** (1 test)
   - Fix mesh component handling

### 3. Choose Next Development Phase (1 day planning)
Review options and choose path:
- **Option A**: Implement missing features (2D mode, layouts)
- **Option B**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Option C**: Performance optimizations
- **Option D**: Documentation and examples

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Today's Tasks
1. ✅ **Test compilation fixed**
   - Bevy updated to main branch
   - All 114 tests compile

2. **Fix ignored tests** (starting now)
   - Focus on event store integration first
   - Document fixes as we go

3. **Continue documentation cleanup**
   - Archive completed work
   - Update progress tracking

### This Week's Goals
1. All tests passing (114/114 instead of 105/114)
2. Documentation fully reconciled
3. Clear plan for next development phase
4. User guide started

## Success Criteria

We'll know we're back on track when:
- ✅ All tests compile without linking errors
- ✅ Test suite runs (even with some ignored)
- ✅ Test inventory documented by domain
- ⏳ All ignored tests fixed
- ⏳ Documentation accurately reflects current state
- ⏳ Clear development plan for next phase
