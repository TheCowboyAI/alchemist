# Graph Current State Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes our current DDD-compliant implementation and identifies next steps for feature development.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What We Have Achieved

#### 1. **100% DDD-Compliant Structure**
```
src/contexts/
├── graph_management/      # Core domain
│   ├── domain.rs         # Pure domain models
│   ├── events.rs         # Past-tense events (no suffix)
│   ├── services.rs       # Verb-phrase services
│   ├── repositories.rs   # Plural storage
│   └── plugin.rs         # Bevy integration
└── visualization/        # Supporting domain
    ├── services.rs       # Animation & rendering
    └── plugin.rs         # Bevy integration
```

#### 2. **Domain Models Implemented**

**Aggregates**
- `Graph` with identity, metadata, and journey ✅
- `Node` with graph reference and content ✅
- `Edge` with relationship properties ✅

**Value Objects**
- `GraphIdentity`, `NodeIdentity`, `EdgeIdentity` ✅
- `GraphMetadata`, `NodeContent`, `EdgeRelationship` ✅
- `SpatialPosition`, `GraphJourney` ✅

#### 3. **Domain Events (No "Event" Suffix)**
```rust
// All implemented correctly:
GraphCreated, NodeAdded, EdgeConnected,
NodeRemoved, EdgeDisconnected, NodeMoved,
PropertyUpdated, LabelApplied, GraphDeleted,
SubgraphImported, SubgraphExtracted
```

#### 4. **Domain Services (Verb Phrases)**
```rust
// Graph Management
CreateGraph, AddNodeToGraph, ConnectGraphNodes,
ValidateGraph, EstablishGraphHierarchy

// Visualization
RenderGraphElements, HandleUserInput,
AnimateGraphElements, ControlCamera
```

#### 5. **Storage (Plural Terms)**
```rust
Graphs           // Graph storage
GraphEvents      // Event store
Nodes           // Node index
Edges           // Edge traversal
```

#### 6. **Working Features**
- 3D visualization with Bevy ✅
- Node spawning and rendering ✅
- Graph hierarchy (parent-child) ✅
- Basic animations (rotation) ✅
- Camera controls ✅
- Event system foundation ✅

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Storage (Week 1)
1. **Daggy Integration**
   - Replace in-memory storage with Daggy
   - Maintain ECS sync layer
   - Add persistence hooks

2. **Event Store Enhancement**
   - Add file-based persistence
   - Implement event replay
   - Create snapshot system

### Phase 2: Essential Visualization (Week 2)
1. **Edge Rendering**
   - Create edge meshes
   - Add arrow heads
   - Support different styles

2. **Selection System**
   - Visual highlighting
   - Multi-selection
   - Selection events

### Phase 3: Basic Import/Export (Week 3)
1. **JSON Format**
   - Graph serialization
   - Node/Edge data
   - Metadata preservation

2. **Simple Layouts**
   - Grid layout
   - Circle layout
   - Basic force-directed

### Phase 4: Analysis Tools (Week 4+)
1. **Path Finding**
   - Shortest path
   - All paths
   - Weighted paths

2. **Basic Metrics**
   - Node degree
   - Graph density
   - Connected components

## Migration Strategy

### Non-Breaking Additions
Since we have a clean DDD foundation, we can add features incrementally:

1. **Storage Layer**: Add alongside current ECS
2. **New Services**: Implement as needed
3. **Additional Events**: Extend event types
4. **Format Support**: Add one at a time

### Testing Approach
```rust
// Unit tests for domain logic
#[test]
fn test_graph_creation() { ... }

// Integration tests for contexts
#[test]
fn test_event_flow() { ... }

// E2E tests for features
#[test]
fn test_full_workflow() { ... }
```

## Success Metrics

### Current Achievement
- ✅ 100% DDD naming compliance
- ✅ Clean bounded contexts
- ✅ Event-driven architecture
- ✅ Working 3D visualization

### Next Milestones
- [ ] Persistent graph storage
- [ ] Complete edge visualization
- [ ] JSON import/export
- [ ] Basic graph algorithms
- [ ] 2D/3D view switching

## Conclusion

We have successfully implemented a clean, DDD-compliant foundation. The architecture is ready for feature development without any refactoring needed. All new features can be added following the established patterns.
