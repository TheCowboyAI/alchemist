# Plan Updated for Incremental Development

## Summary

We have successfully updated the `/doc/plan` documentation to:
1. Reflect our current 100% DDD-compliant implementation
2. Provide clear guidance for incremental feature development
3. Focus on implementing one component at a time

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Incremental Implementation Plan

**File**: `doc/plan/incremental-implementation-plan.md`

This new plan:
- Reflects our current DDD-compliant state
- Breaks development into small, testable components
- Provides specific implementation guidance for each phase
- Focuses on immediate next steps (Edge Visualization)

### 2. Updated Plan README

**File**: `doc/plan/README.md`

The README now:
- Shows our current implementation status
- Highlights the incremental approach
- Provides quick reference for DDD patterns
- Lists working features and what's next

### 3. Updated DDD Compliance Plan

**File**: `doc/plan/ddd-compliance-update-plan.md`

Renamed to "DDD Compliance Achievement and Maintenance Plan":
- Documents that we've achieved 100% compliance
- Focuses on maintaining compliance going forward
- Provides guidelines for new features
- Includes quick reference for patterns

## Current State vs. Plan

### âœ… What's Working (Current State)
```
src/contexts/
â”œâ”€â”€ graph_management/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain.rs        # Entities and value objects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events.rs        # Domain events (no suffix!)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services.rs      # Domain services (verb phrases)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories.rs  # Storage (plural terms)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.rs
â””â”€â”€ visualization/
    â”œâ”€â”€ services.rs      # Visualization services
    â””â”€â”€ plugin.rs
```

**Working Features**:
- Graph creation with metadata
- Node creation and positioning
- 3D node visualization (blue spheres)
- Camera controls
- Graph rotation animation
- Event-driven architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Implementation (From Plan)

**Phase 1: Edge Visualization**

Component 1.1: `RenderGraphEdges` service
- Listen for EdgeConnected events
- Create line meshes between nodes
- Apply edge styling

Component 1.2: Edge visual components
- `EdgeVisual` component
- `EdgeVisualBundle` for Bevy

## Implementation Approach

### One Component at a Time

The plan now emphasizes:
1. Complete one component fully
2. Test with existing features
3. Commit working code
4. Move to next component

### Clear Success Criteria

Each component has specific criteria:
- What it should do
- How to test it
- When it's complete

### Maintain DDD Compliance

Every new addition must follow:
- Events: Past-tense facts
- Services: Verb phrases
- Storage: Plural terms
- No technical suffixes

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Lower Risk**: Small changes are easier to debug
2. **Steady Progress**: Something works every day
3. **Easy Testing**: Each component tested in isolation
4. **Clear Focus**: No confusion about what to do next
5. **Maintained Quality**: DDD compliance throughout

## Next Steps

According to the updated plan:

1. **Immediate**: Implement `RenderGraphEdges` service
2. **This Week**: Complete edge visualization
3. **Next Week**: Start selection system
4. **Following**: Storage layer with Daggy

## Conclusion

The plan now provides a clear, incremental path forward that:
- Builds on our DDD-compliant foundation
- Adds features one at a time
- Maintains system stability
- Ensures steady progress

We can now proceed with confidence, knowing exactly what to implement next and how to maintain our high code quality standards.
