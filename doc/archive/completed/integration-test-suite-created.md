# Integration Test Suite Created

## Summary

Created a comprehensive integration test suite for NATS end-to-end testing as specified in the QA remediation plan. The test suite provides the foundation for verifying the complete event-driven architecture flow.

## What Was Created

### 1. Test Infrastructure (`tests/integration/`)

- **mod.rs**: Main module organizing all integration tests
- **fixtures.rs**: Test helpers and utilities including:
  - Test data generators
  - NATS connection helpers
  - Event stream management
  - Assertion helpers
  - Integration test macro

### 2. Core Integration Tests

#### Event Flow Tests (`event_flow_tests.rs`)
- Complete command to projection flow test
- Multi-aggregate event flow verification
- Complex graph operations with cascade deletes
- Concurrent command processing tests

#### NATS Integration Tests (`nats_integration_tests.rs`)
- Event publishing and consumption
- Event bridge bidirectional flow
- NATS reconnection handling
- JetStream stream management
- Event ordering guarantees

#### CID Chain Tests (`cid_chain_tests.rs`)
- CID chain creation and validation
- Tampering detection
- Parallel event chains
- Event replay with CID verification

#### Error Recovery Tests (`error_recovery_tests.rs`)
- Event store recovery after failure
- Concurrent modification handling
- Event deduplication
- Partial failure rollback
- Event replay after crash

#### Projection Tests (`projection_tests.rs`)
- Placeholder tests for future projection implementation
- Will test projection updates, checkpointing, and replay

## Current Status

The integration test suite structure is complete but requires some additional work:

1. **Command Handler Implementation**: Need to complete the async command handler that bridges domain aggregates with the event store
2. **Event Store Trait Alignment**: The EventStore trait needs to be fully implemented for DistributedEventStore
3. **Domain Event Structure**: Some adjustments needed to align with the actual domain event structure

## Next Steps

1. Fix compilation issues in the command handler and event store implementations
2. Complete the EventBridge integration for command processing
3. Add proper CID serialization support
4. Run the integration tests once compilation issues are resolved

## Test Execution

Once ready, tests can be run with:

```bash
# Start NATS server
nats-server -js

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration -- --nocapture
```

Tests are marked with `#[ignore]` by default since they require a running NATS server.

## Benefits

- Comprehensive coverage of event flow scenarios
- Resilience and error recovery testing
- Performance testing with concurrent operations
- Foundation for continuous integration testing
- Clear separation between unit and integration tests
