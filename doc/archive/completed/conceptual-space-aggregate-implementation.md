# Conceptual Space Aggregate Implementation

**Date**: December 29, 2024
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented the Conceptual Space Aggregate, completing Phase 2 (Graph Domain Model) at 100%.

## Key Concepts Clarified

- **ConceptGraph** is the generic, fundamental building block that can represent ANY graph structure
- **ConceptualSpace** is a specialized type of ConceptGraph that specifically represents GÃ¤rdenfors' geometric knowledge spaces with quality dimensions
- Every ConceptualSpace can be represented as a ConceptGraph (IS-A relationship)
- Not every ConceptGraph is a ConceptualSpace

## Architecture Decisions

### Event Store Strategy
- **NATS JetStream** for domain events (persistent, distributed)
- **In-memory event store** for presentation/UI events (ephemeral, local)
- This aligns with CIM architecture where domain events are the source of truth

## Implementation Details

### 1. Domain Layer

#### Aggregate (`src/domain/aggregates/conceptual_space.rs`)
- Implements event sourcing pattern
- Handles commands: CreateConceptualSpace, AddQualityDimension, MapConcept, DefineRegion, CalculateSimilarity, UpdateMetric
- Maintains state: dimensions, concept mappings, regions, metrics
- Enforces business rules and invariants

#### Commands (`src/domain/commands/conceptual_space.rs`)
- Command types for all conceptual space operations
- Includes metadata for concept mapping
- Supports region definition with member concepts

#### Events (`src/domain/events/conceptual_space.rs`)
- ConceptualSpaceCreated
- QualityDimensionAdded
- ConceptMapped (with metadata)
- RegionDefined (with member concepts)
- SimilarityCalculated
- MetricUpdated

#### Value Objects
- Added ConceptualSpaceId, DimensionId, RegionId to `src/domain/value_objects/base.rs`
- ConceptId imported from conceptual_graph module (not duplicated)

### 2. Application Layer

#### Command Handler (`src/application/command_handlers/conceptual_space_command_handler.rs`)
- Processes ConceptualSpace commands
- Uses dyn EventStore trait for flexibility
- Includes comprehensive tests
- Follows async pattern for NATS integration

### 3. Infrastructure Integration

#### Event Store
- Updated distributed implementation to handle ConceptualSpace events
- Proper aggregate_id extraction for all event types

#### Event Bridge
- Subject router updated with ConceptualSpace event routing
- Follows pattern: `event.conceptual_space.{event_type}.{space_id}`

#### Command Routing
- Graph command handler updated to route ConceptualSpace commands to dedicated handler
- Proper separation of concerns maintained

## Bug Fixes During Implementation

1. **ConceptId Display Trait**: Added Display implementation for error formatting
2. **Ray Direction Type Issues**: Fixed Dir3 to Vec3 conversions in multiple systems
3. **Command Handler Type Mismatches**: Fixed return types in command routing
4. **Borrow Checker Issues**: Resolved mutable/immutable borrow conflicts in subgraph_merge_split

## Testing

- Unit tests included in command handler
- Uses InMemoryEventStore for testing
- Tests cover basic create and dimension addition flows

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the next phase should focus on:
1. Integration testing of the complete domain model
2. UI components for conceptual space visualization
3. Advanced features like concept learning and adaptation
4. Performance optimization for large conceptual spaces

### Modified
- `src/domain/value_objects/base.rs` - Added new ID types
- `src/domain/aggregates/mod.rs` - Added module export
- `src/domain/events/mod.rs` - Added events and DomainEvent variants
- `src/domain/commands/mod.rs` - Added commands and Command enum
- `src/application/command_handlers/mod.rs` - Added handler export
- `src/application/command_handlers/graph_command_handler.rs` - Added routing
- `src/domain/aggregates/graph.rs` - Added event handling
- `src/infrastructure/event_store/distributed_impl.rs` - Added event support
- `src/infrastructure/event_bridge/subject_router.rs` - Added routing
- `src/domain/conceptual_graph/concept.rs` - Added Display trait

## Conclusion

The Conceptual Space Aggregate is now fully implemented and integrated into the CIM architecture. The implementation follows DDD principles, maintains proper boundaries between contexts, and supports the event-driven architecture with both NATS JetStream for persistence and in-memory stores for UI state.
