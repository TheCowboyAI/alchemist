# Workflow Domain Implementation Progress

## Summary
The Workflow domain implementation has been significantly improved with the addition of state machines for both workflows and steps. All 25 user story tests are now passing.

## Completed Work

### State Machine Implementation
- **WorkflowStateMachine**: Full state transition management for workflows
  - Draft → Running → (Completed | Failed | Paused | Cancelled)
  - Pause/Resume support
  - Proper guard conditions and effects
  - Event generation with complete context
  
- **StepStateMachine**: Comprehensive step lifecycle management
  - Pending → Running → (Completed | Failed | WaitingApproval)
  - Approval flow support
  - Retry mechanism with configurable limits
  - Context-aware transitions

### Key Improvements Made
1. **State Machine Integration**
   - Proper state transitions with guards and effects
   - Event generation includes full context (including started_by)
   - Custom PartialEq for transitions ignoring field values
   - Mermaid diagram generation for visualization

2. **Event Handling**
   - Fixed WorkflowStarted event to include started_by from context
   - Proper state transition tracking in context
   - Duration calculation for completed/failed workflows

3. **Value Objects**
   - Added Hash derive to WorkflowStatus and StepStatus
   - Added Display trait to StepType
   - Proper serialization support

4. **Test Fixes**
   - Fixed context requirements for workflow start
   - Updated error message assertions for state machine errors
   - All 25 user story tests passing

## Architecture Highlights

### State Machine Pattern
```rust
// Workflow transitions are now managed by state machine
workflow.start(context, started_by)
  → WorkflowStateMachine.transition(Start)
  → Guards check context has variables
  → Effects initialize metrics
  → Event generated with proper context
  → Status updated to Running
```

### Event-Driven Updates
All state changes go through proper events:
- WorkflowStarted (includes started_by from context)
- WorkflowCompleted (includes duration)
- StepStarted, StepCompleted, StepFailed
- TaskAssigned, TaskCompleted

### Context Management
- Workflow context tracks all state transitions
- Variables stored as JSON values
- Metadata for integration configuration
- Proper context passing through state machines

## Test Coverage
- 38 unit tests in lib.rs
- 4 domain tests
- 25 user story tests
- 1 doc test
- **Total: 68 tests passing**

## Next Steps
The Workflow domain is now feature-complete with robust state management. Future enhancements could include:
- Performance optimizations for large workflows
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics
- Advanced scheduling capabilities
- Workflow migration tools for version upgrades
