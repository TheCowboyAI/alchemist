# Design Folder Cleanup - June 28, 2025

This archive contains design documents that were moved from `/doc/design` during the v0.4.1 cleanup.

## Why These Were Archived

These documents represent:
1. **Completed Implementations**: Designs that have been fully implemented
2. **Outdated Approaches**: Design decisions that were superseded
3. **Historical Context**: Important for understanding evolution but not current practice

## What Remains Current

The `/doc/design/current` folder contains only actively used design documents that reflect the current architecture and implementation approach.

## Archive Contents

- Identity domain refactoring designs (completed in v0.4.0)
- Graph abstraction layer design (completed in all 4 phases)
- Various domain-specific designs that have been implemented
- Correlation/causation designs (implemented in cim-subject)
