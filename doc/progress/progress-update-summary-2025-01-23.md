# Progress Update Summary - January 23, 2025

## Overview

Updated progress tracking to reflect actual project status: **~65% complete with 14 domains** (not 100% complete with 8 domains).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Accurate Domain Count
- **Previous claim**: 8 domains, 100% complete
- **Reality**: 14 domains, ~65% complete
- **Total tests**: 271+ passing (not 203)

### 2. Documents Updated

#### Created
- `domain-status-2025-01-23.md` - Comprehensive accurate status report
- `progress-json-update-plan.md` - Plan for updating progress.json
- This summary document

#### Updated
- `doc/progress/README.md` - Reflects accurate 14 domain count and ~65% completion
- `readme.md` (main project) - Updated from "100% complete" to "~65% complete"

#### Archived
- `workflow-domain-completion-final.md` → `archive-2025-01-23/`
- `event-driven-architecture-final-assessment.md` → `archive-2025-01-23/`

### 3. Domain Status Corrections

#### Production-Ready (>90%)
1. Graph (95%) - 41 tests
2. Identity (95%) - 27 tests  
3. Nix (95%) - 68 tests
4. Git (90%) - 27 tests

#### Partially Complete (50-89%)
5. Workflow (70%) - 26 tests
6. Policy (70%) - 22 tests
7. Location (70%) - 23 tests
8. ConceptualSpaces (60%) - 25 tests
9. Document (50%) - 5 tests
10. Organization (50%) - 7 tests

#### Early Stage (<50%)
11. Agent (40%) - 5 tests
12. Person (30%) - 0 tests
13. Dialog (20%) - 0 tests
14. Bevy (20%) - 0 tests

### 4. Identified Issues

1. **Overly optimistic reporting** - Previous documents claimed 100% completion
2. **Missing domains** - 6 domains weren't being tracked
3. **Placeholder tests** - Many "should panic" tests counted as complete
4. **Inconsistent test counts** - Numbers didn't match actual test output

### 5. Next Steps

1. **Update progress.json** - Follow the update plan to correct the main tracking file
2. **Complete high-priority domains**:
   - Workflow (critical for CIM vision)
   - ConceptualSpaces (AI reasoning)
   - Dialog (agent interactions)
3. **Cross-domain integration** - Implement event choreography
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Replace placeholder tests with real implementations

## Conclusion

The progress tracking now accurately reflects the project's state. While significant progress has been made (271+ tests passing), there's still substantial work to complete the CIM vision. The project is approximately 65% complete with 14 domains in various stages of implementation.
