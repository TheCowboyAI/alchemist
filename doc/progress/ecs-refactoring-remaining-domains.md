   - Needed: ECS components for spatial representation and queries
   - Effort: High (complex mathematical operations)

#### Medium Priority (Supporting Features)
3. **Git Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic for repository management
   - Needed: ECS components for commit visualization
   - Effort: Medium

4. **Location Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic for geographic data
   - Needed: ECS components for spatial queries
   - Effort: Low

5. **Artifact Domain**
   - Current: Basic domain structure
   - Needed: Full ECS refactoring
   - Effort: Low

#### Lower Priority (Future Features)
6. **Project Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
   - Effort: Medium

7. **Task Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
   - Effort: Medium

8. **Document Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Domains (Next Sprint)
- [x] Agent Domain - Enable AI agent visualization âœ…
- [ ] Workflow Domain - Critical for CIM vision
- [ ] ConceptualSpaces Domain - Semantic reasoning

### Phase 2: Supporting Domains
- [ ] Git Domain - Version control integration
- [ ] Location Domain - Geographic features
- [ ] Artifact Domain - Asset management

### Phase 3: Extended Features
- [ ] Project Domain
- [ ] Task Domain
- [ ] Document Domain
- [ ] Communication Domain

## Technical Patterns Established

From completed domains, we have established:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Entity components (e.g., GraphEntity, PolicyEntity, AgentEntity)
   - Metadata components for additional data
   - Status/State components for lifecycle
   - Relationship components for connections
   - Activity tracking components

2. **System Organization**
   - Lifecycle systems (create, update, delete)
   - Query systems for data retrieval
   - Event processing systems
   - Integration systems for cross-domain
   - Monitoring and activity tracking

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - Unit tests per system
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Event flow validation
   - Async-sync bridge testing
   - Readiness and health checks

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - AsyncSyncBridge for domain-ECS communication
   - Domain-specific bridges (e.g., GraphBridge)
   - Bevy plugins for easy integration
   - Event wrappers for ECS compatibility

## Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 35.7% (5/14)
- **Tests Added**: 59+ (Graph: 48, Policy: 7, Agent: 4+)
- **Components Created**: 150+ across all domains
- **Systems Implemented**: 60+ across all domains
- **Estimated Remaining Effort**: 70-100 hours
- **Target Completion**: Q2 2025

## Recent Achievements (2025-01-27)

### Agent Domain Highlights
- **Components**: 30+ component types across 7 modules
  - Core agent components with health and resource tracking
  - Comprehensive capability management with usage statistics
  - Full authentication system with audit trail
  - Permission system with roles and inheritance
  - Tool management with execution tracking
- **Systems**: 15+ systems for complete agent lifecycle
- **Integration**: Ready for AI agent visualization and management
