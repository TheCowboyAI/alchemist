# ECS Refactoring Progress - Remaining Domains

## Status: 4/14 Domains Complete (28.6%)

### âœ… Completed Domains
1. **Identity Domain** - Full ECS refactoring with components and systems
2. **Policy Domain** - Complete with 7 integration tests (2025-01-27)
3. **Graph Domain** - Complete with 48 tests and abstraction layer (2025-01-27)
4. **Person Domain** - Basic ECS structure in place

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Domains (10)

#### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Agent Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic only
   - Needed: ECS components for AI agents, capabilities, interactions
   - Effort: Medium

2. **Workflow Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic with workflow execution
   - Needed: ECS components for workflow visualization and execution
   - Effort: High (complex state management)

3. **ConceptualSpaces Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic for semantic spaces
   - Needed: ECS components for spatial representation and queries
   - Effort: High (complex mathematical operations)

#### Medium Priority (Supporting Features)
4. **Git Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic for repository management
   - Needed: ECS components for commit visualization
   - Effort: Medium

5. **Location Domain**
   - Current: Domain logic for geographic data
   - Needed: ECS components for spatial queries
   - Effort: Low

6. **Artifact Domain**
   - Current: Basic domain structure
   - Needed: Full ECS refactoring
   - Effort: Low

#### Lower Priority (Future Features)
7. **Project Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
   - Effort: Medium

8. **Task Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
   - Effort: Medium

9. **Document Domain**
   - Current: Not implemented
   - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
   - Effort: Low

10. **Communication Domain**
    - Current: Not implemented
    - Needed: Full domain + ECS implementation
    - Effort: Medium

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Domains (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Agent Domain - Enable AI agent visualization
- [ ] Workflow Domain - Critical for CIM vision
- [ ] ConceptualSpaces Domain - Semantic reasoning

### Phase 2: Supporting Domains
- [ ] Git Domain - Version control integration
- [ ] Location Domain - Geographic features
- [ ] Artifact Domain - Asset management

### Phase 3: Extended Features
- [ ] Project Domain
- [ ] Task Domain
- [ ] Document Domain
- [ ] Communication Domain

## Technical Patterns Established

From completed domains, we have established:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Entity components (e.g., GraphEntity, PolicyEntity)
   - Metadata components for additional data
   - Status/State components for lifecycle
   - Relationship components for connections

2. **System Organization**
   - Lifecycle systems (create, update, delete)
   - Query systems for data retrieval
   - Event processing systems
   - Integration systems for cross-domain

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - Unit tests per system
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Event flow validation
   - Async-sync bridge testing

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - AsyncSyncBridge for domain-ECS communication
   - Domain-specific bridges (e.g., GraphBridge)
   - Bevy plugins for easy integration

## Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: 28.6% (4/14)
- **Tests Added**: 55+ (Graph: 48, Policy: 7)
- **Estimated Remaining Effort**: 80-120 hours
- **Target Completion**: Q2 2025
