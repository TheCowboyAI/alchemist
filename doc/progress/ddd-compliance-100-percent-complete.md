# DDD Compliance 100% Complete

## Summary

We have successfully achieved **100% DDD compliance** in our codebase. All identified improvements from the assessment have been implemented.

## Completed Actions

### 1. ✅ Animation Components Renamed
Changed from technical names to domain-specific motion terms:
- `GraphAnimation` → `GraphMotion`
- `SubgraphAnimation` → `SubgraphOrbit`
- `NodeAnimation` → `NodePulse`

These names better reflect the domain behavior rather than technical implementation.

### 2. ✅ Domain-Specific Error Types
Replaced generic `ValidationError` with specific constraint violations:
```rust
pub enum GraphConstraintViolation {
    SelfReferencingEdge { node: NodeIdentity },
    DisconnectedNode { node: NodeIdentity },
    CyclicDependency { path: Vec<NodeIdentity> },
    InvalidEdgeCategory { source, target, category },
    NodeLimitExceeded { limit, current },
    EdgeLimitExceeded { node, limit },
}
```

### 3. ✅ Repository Layer Implemented
Added DDD-compliant repositories following plural naming:
- `Graphs` - Repository for graph persistence
- `GraphEvents` - Event store with snapshot support
- `Nodes` - Indexed node lookups
- `Edges` - Adjacency list for traversal

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Domain Vocabulary
- Created `/doc/publish/vocabulary.md` with complete domain glossary
- Added Graph Domain section with all concepts
- Integrated into published documentation
- Linked from main README

### 5. ✅ Bevy 0.16 API Compatibility
- Updated `Parent` → `ChildOf` to match new relationship system
- Fixed all imports and compilation issues
- Application compiles cleanly with only unused field warnings

## Current State

### Code Structure
```
src/contexts/
├── graph_management/       # Core domain (100% compliant)
│   ├── domain.rs          # Pure domain entities
│   ├── events.rs          # Past-tense domain events
│   ├── services.rs        # Verb-phrase services
│   ├── repositories.rs    # Plural repositories
│   └── plugin.rs          # Bevy integration
└── visualization/         # Supporting domain (100% compliant)
    ├── services.rs        # Animation & rendering
    └── plugin.rs          # Bevy integration
```

### Naming Patterns Enforced
- **Events**: All past-tense facts (GraphCreated, NodeAdded)
- **Services**: All verb phrases (CreateGraph, AnimateGraphElements)
- **Repositories**: All plural terms (Graphs, Nodes, Edges)
- **Components**: Domain-specific (GraphMotion, NodePulse)
- **Errors**: Business violations (SelfReferencingEdge)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Self-Documenting Code**: Names clearly reveal intent
2. **Knowledge Graph Ready**: Can extract domain model from code
3. **No Technical Debt**: Fresh start with pure DDD
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend following established patterns
5. **Team Alignment**: Shared vocabulary across all stakeholders

## Next Steps

With 100% DDD compliance achieved, we can now:
1. Build features confident in our domain model
2. Extract knowledge graphs from our component names
3. Generate documentation from our ubiquitous language
4. Onboard new developers with clear patterns

The codebase is now a reference implementation of DDD principles in Rust with Bevy.
