# Workflow Domain Extraction Complete

## Summary

The workflow domain has been successfully extracted from `cim-domain` into a separate git submodule `cim-domain-workflow`.

## What Was Done

1. **Created Git Submodule**
   - Created `cim-domain-workflow` directory
   - Initialized as git repository
   - Added as submodule linked to https://github.com/thecowboyai/cim-domain-workflow

2. **Moved Workflow Code**
   - Moved all workflow-related modules from `cim-domain/src/workflow/`
   - Organized into proper DDD structure:
     - `aggregate/` - WorkflowAggregate
     - `commands/` - WorkflowCommand
     - `events/` - WorkflowEvent types
     - `handlers/` - WorkflowCommandHandler
     - `projections/` - WorkflowStatusProjection
     - `value_objects/` - State, Transition, Category types

3. **Fixed Dependencies**
   - Resolved circular dependency between cim-domain and cim-domain-workflow
   - Updated imports to use correct paths
   - Fixed type mismatches and compilation errors

4. **Updated Tests**
   - Fixed all test imports
   - Updated event types to use local definitions
   - All tests now pass successfully

## Key Changes

- **WorkflowId and GraphId**: Still defined in cim-domain (should eventually move to cim-core-domain)
- **AggregateRoot**: Using cim-domain's version instead of cim-core-domain
- **SimpleState**: Fixed to use the struct instead of String type alias
- **TransitionId/StateId**: Fixed to use new() instead of from()
- **WorkflowStatus**: Added missing Cancelled variant

## Test Results

All tests pass:
- 19 unit tests in the library
- 3 integration tests
- 0 doc tests

## Next Steps

1. Push the submodule to its GitHub repository
2. Consider moving WorkflowId and GraphId to cim-core-domain
3. Consider moving CQRS types to cim-core-domain
4. Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## Status: COMPLETE âœ“
