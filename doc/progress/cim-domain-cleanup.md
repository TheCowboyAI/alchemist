# CIM Domain Cleanup

## Overview

Cleaned up unused imports and code in the cim-domain module to resolve all compilation warnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Unused Imports

**command_handlers.rs**:
- Removed unused imports that were left over after command handlers were moved to domain modules:
  - `commands::*`
  - `CommandAcknowledgment`, `CommandEnvelope`, `CommandHandler`, `CommandStatus`
  - `entity::EntityId`

**query_handlers.rs**:
- Removed unused imports:
  - `Query`, `QueryHandler as CqrsQueryHandler`, `QueryEnvelope`, `QueryAcknowledgment`, `QueryStatus`
  - `uuid::Uuid`
- Removed unused `EventPublisher` trait and `MockEventPublisher` since `publish_query_result` was never used

**domain_events.rs**:
- Removed unused `std::collections::HashMap` import (fixed by cargo fix)

### 2. Removed Unused Code

**bevy_bridge.rs**:
- Removed the entire `ComponentMapper` struct and implementation
- This struct was defined but never actually used in the codebase
- Removed the `component_mapper` field from `NatsToBevyTranslator`

### 3. Added Missing Documentation

**lib.rs**:
- Added documentation for the `AggregateId` type alias:
  ```rust
  /// Type alias for aggregate identifiers using EntityId with AggregateMarker
  pub type AggregateId = EntityId<markers::AggregateMarker>;
  ```

## Result

All compilation warnings in cim-domain have been resolved. The module now compiles cleanly without any warnings.

## Impact

- Cleaner codebase with no unused code
- Better documentation coverage
- No functional changes - only cleanup of unused elements
