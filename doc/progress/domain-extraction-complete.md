# Domain Extraction Complete

## Summary

All domains have been successfully extracted from `cim-domain` into their respective submodules:

### Extracted Domains

1. **cim-domain-graph** ✅
   - Graph aggregate and components
   - Node and edge management
   - Graph visualization support
   - GitHub: https://github.com/thecowboyai/cim-domain-graph

2. **cim-domain-workflow** ✅
   - Workflow aggregate
   - State machine integration
   - Process automation
   - 22 tests passing

3. **cim-domain-location** ✅
   - Location aggregate
   - Geospatial components
   - Address management
   - 6 tests passing

4. **cim-domain-document** ✅
   - Document aggregate
   - Content management
   - Version tracking

5. **cim-domain-policy** ✅
   - Policy aggregate
   - Rule enforcement
   - Security policies

6. **cim-domain-agent** ✅
   - Agent aggregate
   - Capability management
   - Tool access control

7. **cim-domain-organization** ✅
   - Organization aggregate
   - Hierarchical structures
   - Member management

8. **cim-domain-person** ✅
   - Person aggregate
   - Identity management
   - Contact information

## Architecture

- **cim-domain** now contains only core DDD infrastructure:
  - Entity, Component, AggregateRoot traits
  - Command, Query, Event infrastructure
  - CQRS implementation
  - Error types
  - Identifiers (NodeId, EdgeId, etc.)

- **cim-core-domain** stub has been removed

- Each domain is a separate git submodule with its own repository

## Integration Status

### Completed
- All domains extracted with proper DDD structure
- Dependencies updated to use cim-domain
- Git submodules configured
- Basic compilation working

### Known Issues
- Some trait definition mismatches between domains and core
- Integration tests need adjustment for current architecture
- Some domains may need updates to align with core traits

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement integration tests from QA remediation plan
   - Test cross-domain communication
   - Verify event flow through NATS

2. **Documentation**
   - Document current CQRS architecture
   - Create examples for each domain
   - Update developer guides

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Consider aligning domain trait implementations
   - Implement missing command handlers
   - Add projection support

## Graph Domain as Composition Layer

The graph domain serves as the core composition layer where all other domains can be visualized and connected:
- Other domains can be represented as nodes
- Relationships are edges
- Enables visual workflow design
- Supports conceptual space integration
