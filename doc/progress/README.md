# Current Work in Progress

This directory should contain ONLY documentation for work that is currently in progress.

## Purpose

- Track ongoing implementation efforts
- Document current sprint/phase work
- Capture in-flight design decisions
- Record blockers and solutions

## Guidelines

1. **Start Progress Document**: When beginning new work, create a progress document
2. **Update Regularly**: Keep progress documents current during implementation
3. **Move When Complete**: Once work is done, move the document to `/doc/completed/`

## Current Work

*This directory is currently empty as we're between implementation phases.*

Next work to begin:
- Phase 1: Edge Visualization (see `/doc/plan/incremental-implementation-plan.md`)

## Document Format

Progress documents should include:
- **Goal**: What we're implementing
- **Approach**: How we're implementing it
- **Progress**: What's been done
- **Blockers**: Any issues encountered
- **Next Steps**: What remains

## Note

For completed work, see `/doc/completed/`
For implementation plans, see `/doc/plan/`
