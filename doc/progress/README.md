# Current Work in Progress

This directory should contain ONLY documentation for work that is currently in progress.

## Purpose

- Track ongoing implementation efforts
- Document current sprint/phase work
- Capture in-flight design decisions
- Record blockers and solutions

## Guidelines

1. **Start Progress Document**: When beginning new work, create a progress document
2. **Update Regularly**: Keep progress documents current during implementation
3. **Move When Complete**: Once work is done, move the document to `/doc/completed/`

## Current Work

**Active Work: Phase 1 Manual Testing Verification**
- Document: [Phase 1 Manual Testing Update](phase-1-manual-testing-update.md)
- Status: IN PROGRESS - Testing checklist updated, building app for verification
- Started: Today
- Estimated Completion: Today

### Today's Progress:
1. âœ… Updated manual testing checklist with exact instructions
2. âœ… Verified what features are actually implemented vs documented
3. ðŸ”„ Building application for manual testing
4. [ ] Run through updated checklist to verify functionality

### Key Findings:
- Many features exist in code but may not be fully wired up
- No UI for graph/node/edge creation (only example graph)
- Some render modes and edge types may not work visually
- Headless tests can't verify visual features

## Previous Work

*Phase 1: Core features have been implemented and tested*
- See `/doc/completed/` for completed phase 1 work
- See `/doc/qa/` for quality assurance reports

## Document Format

Progress documents should include:
- **Goal**: What we're implementing
- **Approach**: How we're implementing it
- **Progress**: What's been done
- **Blockers**: Any issues encountered
- **Next Steps**: What remains

## Note

For completed work, see `/doc/completed/`
For implementation plans, see `/doc/plan/`
