# CIM Integration Progress

## Current Status

Information Alchemist is being transformed from a standalone application into a sophisticated CIM (Composable Information Machine) leaf node interface. This represents a major architectural shift that brings distributed capabilities, conceptual spaces, and AI readiness.

**ðŸŽ¯ Dog-Fooding Alert**: This progress tracking system will be one of the first graphs loaded into Information Alchemist itself, creating a self-referential system where the tool visualizes its own development journey!

### ðŸš§ Current Phase: Phase 1.5 - IPLD Integration (Week 2-3)

We are now implementing the full IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) architecture to enable content-addressed storage and intelligent information handling:

**Current Tasks**:
- [ ] **IPLD Codec Registry** (0%)
  - Implement domain-specific IPLD codecs (0x300000-0x3FFFFF range)
  - Create codec registration system
  - Add serialization/deserialization for all content types
- [ ] **Object Store Integration** (0%)
  - Integrate NATS Object Store for content-addressed storage
  - Implement put/get operations with CID keys
  - Add content deduplication
- [ ] **Typed Content Implementation** (0%)

**Why This Matters**: IPLD integration enables:
- **Type-safe content addressing** with domain-specific codecs

## Self-Referential Development

### The Dog-Fooding Journey

Information Alchemist will use itself to understand its own development:

1. **Progress Visualization**: The `progress.json` file will be loaded as a graph
2. **Git Integration**: Commit history will be transformed into graph events
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Development activities streamed through NATS
4. **Pattern Detection**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights to improve the tool itself

### Benefits of Self-Visualization

- **Immediate Feedback**: Test features on real, meaningful data
- **Living Documentation**: Interactive visualization of project evolution
- **Team Insights**: Understand collaboration patterns and velocity
- **Quality Improvement**: Detect issues early through pattern analysis

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### Architecture Evolution
- **From**: Local event sourcing with file storage
- **To**: Distributed event sourcing via NATS JetStream with CID chains

### Communication
- **From**: Internal event bus
- **To**: NATS subjects for all backend communication with IPLD

### Storage
- **From**: Local JSON files
- **To**: Distributed Event Store + Object Store with content addressing

### Features
- **Added**: Conceptual spaces, game theory, AI readiness, dog-fooding, IPLD
- **Enhanced**: Multi-user collaboration, distributed queries, self-analysis

## Progress Tracking

The progress is tracked in `progress.json` which can be loaded into Information Alchemist once the graph visualization is working. This creates a self-referential system where the tool tracks its own development.

### Viewing Progress

```bash
# View the progress graph structure
cat progress.json | jq .

# Once Information Alchemist is running:
# 1. Load progress.json as a graph
# 2. Visualize development timeline
# 3. Analyze phase dependencies
# 4. Track completion status
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Week):
   - Implement IPLD codec registry
   - Create TypedContent trait and implementations
   - Integrate NATS Object Store
   - Note: Run all tests via `nix build` or `nix run` (not cargo test directly)

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks):
   - Complete IPLD relationship system
   - Add domain tests for all aggregates
   - Set up test coverage metrics (using `nix develop -c cargo llvm-cov`)
   - Begin dog-fooding with progress.json visualization

3. **Medium Term** (Weeks 4-6):
   - Implement conceptual spaces
   - Add game theory components
   - Create AI agent interface
   - Full git integration for development tracking

## Development Workflow

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Build the project (includes running tests)
nix build

# Run the application
nix run

# Enter development shell for manual commands
nix develop

# Run tests with coverage (once cargo-llvm-cov is added)
nix develop -c cargo llvm-cov --lib --no-default-features --html
```

**Important**: Due to dynamic linking requirements with Bevy, always use the Nix commands above. Direct `cargo test` will fail with symbol lookup errors.

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: Full CIM integration with all phases complete
- **Performance**: 100K+ nodes, <100ms distributed queries
- **Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, security audit passed
- **Dog-Fooding**: 5+ actionable insights per week from self-analysis
- **Timeline**: Complete by July 30, 2025
