# CIM Integration Progress

## Current Status

Information Alchemist is being transformed into a CIM (Composable Information Machine) leaf node UI with event sourcing, conceptual spaces, and AI readiness. The project has completed foundational infrastructure and is now addressing QA compliance gaps before proceeding with Phase 2.

**Current Focus**: Addressing QA compliance gaps - Graph Aggregate implementation completed (June 2025)

## Progress Overview

### âœ… Phase 0: NATS Integration Foundation - COMPLETED (100%)
- **NATS Client Setup**: Basic client with connection management
- **Basic Graph Visualization**: Bevy-based graph rendering with nodes and edges
- **Event-Driven Animation**: Smooth transitions for graph mutations
- **Security Configuration**: JWT auth, TLS, and credentials support
- **Event Bridge Architecture**: Async/sync bridge between NATS and Bevy ECS

### âœ… Phase 1: Distributed Event Infrastructure - COMPLETED (100%)
- **JetStream Event Store**: Distributed event store with JetStream
- **Event Structure Migration**: New NodeEvent structure with metadata
- **CID Chain Implementation**: Content-addressed event chains with BLAKE3 hashing
- **Event Replay Mechanism**: Event replay from any point using CID chains

### âœ… Phase 1.5: IPLD Integration - COMPLETED (100%)
- **CIM-IPLD Library**: Extracted to github.com/TheCowboyAI/cim-ipld
- **IA-Specific Content Types**: GraphContent, NodeIPLDContent, EdgeIPLDContent, etc.
- **Object Store Integration**: NATS Object Store with compression and caching
- **Custom Codecs**: Pending implementation

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Graph Domain Model - IN PROGRESS (25%)
- **Graph Aggregate**: âœ… COMPLETED - All command handlers implemented with business rules
- **Node/Edge Entities**: Pending - Rich domain objects with behavior
- **Graph Commands**: Pending - Command pattern for graph mutations
- **Domain Events**: Pending - Event types for all graph operations

### ðŸ“… Upcoming Phases

**Phase 3: CQRS Implementation**
- Command Handlers
- Query Handlers
- Projections
- Snapshot Management

**Phase 4: Conceptual Space Integration**
- Embedding Service
- Similarity Calculations
- Conceptual Mapping
- Knowledge-Aware Layout

**Phase 5: AI Agent Integration**
- Agent Protocol
- Tool Interface
- Semantic Search
- Workflow Automation

**Phase 6: Dog-fooding & Polish**
- Progress Visualization
- Development Workflow
- Performance Optimization
- Documentation

## Recent Achievements

### Graph Aggregate Implementation âœ… (June 2025)
- Implemented all command handlers for Graph, Node, and Edge commands
- Added comprehensive business rule validation
- Enforced DDD principles with value object immutability
- Created 20 comprehensive tests - all passing
- Fixed event structure mismatches

### QA Compliance Review (June 2025)
- Overall compliance: 78%
- Identified critical gaps in domain model, test coverage, and integration tests
- Created remediation plan with prioritized actions

### Key Infrastructure Completed
- **NATS Event Replay**: Tested with 114 events
- **Bevy 0.16 Linking**: Fixed experimental feature issues
- **Dynamic Linking**: Resolved - use `nix build` or `nix run`
- **Test Suite**: 90+ tests passing

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Priority 1: Create integration test suite with NATS end-to-end tests**
2. **Priority 1: Implement read model projections for CQRS queries**
3. Update Phase 2 task status to reflect graph aggregate completion
4. Increase test coverage to 80% minimum
5. Document TDD workflow with examples
6. Begin command handler implementation in application layer

## Current Blockers

- Test coverage below 80% target - quality gate not met
- Missing integration tests - cannot verify end-to-end functionality
- Read model projections not implemented - CQRS incomplete

## Development Workflow

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Build the project
nix build

# Run the application
nix run

# Enter development shell
nix develop

# Run tests
nix develop -c cargo test
```

**Important**: Due to Bevy dynamic linking requirements, always use Nix commands.

## Progress Tracking

This folder contains the current progress tracking for the Information Alchemist CIM implementation.

## Main Progress File

- **`progress.json`** - The single source of truth for project progress. This file contains:
  - A graph structure of all milestones, tasks, and phases
  - Current status of each component
  - Relationships between different work items
  - Historical notes and accomplishments

## Current Status (January 6, 2025)

- **Phase 0 (NATS Integration)**: âœ… Complete
- **Phase 1 (Event Infrastructure)**: âœ… Complete
- **Phase 1.5 (IPLD Integration)**: âœ… Complete
- **Phase 2 (Graph Domain Model)**: ðŸš§ 60% Complete
- **Phase 3 (CQRS Implementation)**: ðŸš§ 40% Complete
- **Phase 4 (Conceptual Spaces)**: ðŸ“… Pending
- **Phase 5 (AI Agent Integration)**: ðŸ“… Pending
- **Phase 6 (Dog-fooding & Polish)**: ðŸ“… Pending

## Recent Accomplishments

### January 6, 2025
- âœ… Completed Graph aggregate with full command handlers and business rules
- âœ… Created comprehensive integration test suite (end-to-end, error recovery, projections)
- âœ… Implemented read model projections with GraphSummaryProjection
- âœ… Designed bidirectional event flow architecture for external system integration
- âœ… Fixed all linting errors - application now compiles cleanly
- âœ… Application runs successfully with cargo watch support

## How to Use

1. **Check Current Status**: Open `progress.json` and look for:
   - `current_focus` - What we're working on now
   - `next_steps` - Prioritized list of upcoming tasks
   - `blockers` - Any issues preventing progress

2. **Update Progress**: When completing tasks:
   - Update the relevant node's status and progress percentage
   - Add details about what was accomplished
   - Update the `updated` timestamp and version
   - Add notes about significant accomplishments

3. **Visualize Progress**: The progress.json file is designed to be visualized as a graph in the Information Alchemist itself (dog-fooding).

## Archived Documents

Completed phase documents have been moved to `/doc/archive/`:
- `phase-0-nats-integration-completed.md`
- `phase-1-event-infrastructure-completed.md`
- `event-sourcing-progress-graph-old.md`

## Next Steps

See `progress.json` for the current `next_steps` array, which includes:
- Implementing remaining domain aggregates (Workflow, ConceptualSpace)
- Creating command handlers for all domain operations
- Increasing test coverage to 80% minimum
- Documenting domain model patterns

## Version History

The progress.json file uses semantic versioning:
- Major version: Significant phase completions
- Minor version: Milestone completions
- Patch version: Daily updates

Current version: 2.9.0

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: Full CIM integration with all phases complete
- **Performance**: 100K+ nodes, <100ms distributed queries
- **Quality**: 80%+ test coverage
- **Timeline**: Complete by July 30, 2025
