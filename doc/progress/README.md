# CIM Integration Progress

## Current Status

Information Alchemist is being transformed from a standalone application into a sophisticated CIM (Composable Information Machine) leaf node. This represents a major architectural shift that brings distributed capabilities, conceptual spaces, and AI readiness.

**ðŸŽ¯ Dog-Fooding Alert**: This progress tracking system will be one of the first graphs loaded into Information Alchemist itself, creating a self-referential system where the tool visualizes its own development journey!

## Progress Overview

### âœ… Completed Milestones

1. **Migration Started** - Decision made to adopt event sourcing architecture
2. **Architecture Design** - Initial event sourcing design completed
3. **Legacy System Archived** - Old code moved to `/doc/archive/2024-12-legacy/`
4. **Project Setup** - New structure created and compiling
5. **Vocabulary Updated** - Terms updated for event sourcing
6. **CIM Design Justification** - Comprehensive justification based on research
7. **CIM Architecture Revision** - Design and plan updated for full CIM integration
8. **Dog-Fooding Strategy Designed** - Self-referential visualization system planned

### ðŸš§ Current Phase: Phase 0 - NATS Integration Foundation (Week 1)

We are currently implementing the foundation for NATS communication:

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **NATS Client Setup** - Configure async NATS client with JetStream
- [ ] **Security Configuration** - JWT auth, TLS, credentials
- [ ] **Event Bridge Architecture** - Bridge between NATS and Bevy ECS

**Why This Matters**: NATS is the communication backbone of CIM. All backend operations will flow through NATS subjects, enabling distributed scalability and real-time collaboration.

### ðŸ“… Upcoming Phases

1. **Phase 1: Distributed Event Infrastructure** (Week 2)
   - JetStream event store
   - Object store integration
   - Content addressing (CID)

2. **Phase 2: Domain Model with CIM Extensions** (Week 3)
   - Conceptual positioning components
   - Game theory components
   - Distributed repository pattern
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Progress graph loader implementation**

3. **Phase 3: Conceptual Spaces Implementation** (Week 4)
   - Spatial knowledge representation
   - Similarity metrics
   - Enhanced force-directed layout
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Git integration foundation**

4. **Phase 4: Game Theory Components** (Week 5)
   - Strategy system
   - Utility calculations
   - Coalition formation
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Dual graph visualization (planned vs actual)**

5. **Phase 5: AI Agent Interface** (Week 6)
   - Agent communication via NATS
   - Analysis workflows
   - Suggestion handling
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Real-time git monitoring**

6. **Phase 6: Full CIM Integration** (Week 7)
   - Distributed queries
   - Multi-user collaboration
   - State synchronization
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Development analytics**

7. **Phase 7: Advanced Features & Polish** (Week 8)
   - Multi-dimensional projections
   - Temporal navigation
   - Performance optimization
   - **ðŸ”„ Dog-Fooding: Self-improvement loop**

## Self-Referential Development

### The Dog-Fooding Journey

Information Alchemist will use itself to understand its own development:

1. **Progress Visualization**: The `progress.json` file will be loaded as a graph
2. **Git Integration**: Commit history will be transformed into graph events
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Development activities streamed through NATS
4. **Pattern Detection**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights to improve the tool itself

### Benefits of Self-Visualization

- **Immediate Feedback**: Test features on real, meaningful data
- **Living Documentation**: Interactive visualization of project evolution
- **Team Insights**: Understand collaboration patterns and velocity
- **Quality Improvement**: Detect issues early through pattern analysis

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### Architecture Evolution
- **From**: Local event sourcing with file storage
- **To**: Distributed event sourcing via NATS JetStream

### Communication
- **From**: Internal event bus
- **To**: NATS subjects for all backend communication

### Storage
- **From**: Local JSON files
- **To**: Distributed Event Store + Object Store

### Features
- **Added**: Conceptual spaces, game theory, AI readiness, dog-fooding
- **Enhanced**: Multi-user collaboration, distributed queries, self-analysis

## Progress Tracking

The progress is tracked in `progress.json` which can be loaded into Information Alchemist once the graph visualization is working. This creates a self-referential system where the tool tracks its own development.

### Viewing Progress

```bash
# View the progress graph structure
cat progress.json | jq .

# Once Information Alchemist is running:
# 1. Load progress.json as a graph
# 2. Visualize development timeline
# 3. Analyze phase dependencies
# 4. Track completion status
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Week):
   - Set up NATS development environment
   - Implement NATS client with security
   - Create event bridge between NATS and Bevy

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks):
   - Integrate JetStream for event persistence
   - Implement object store client
   - Extend domain model with CIM concepts
   - Begin dog-fooding with progress visualization

3. **Medium Term** (Weeks 4-6):
   - Implement conceptual spaces
   - Add game theory components
   - Create AI agent interface
   - Full git integration for development tracking

## Success Metrics

- **Functional**: Full CIM integration with all phases complete
- **Performance**: 100K+ nodes, <100ms distributed queries
- **Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, security audit passed
- **Dog-Fooding**: 5+ actionable insights per week from self-analysis
- **Timeline**: Complete by July 30, 2025
