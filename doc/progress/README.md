# CIM Integration Progress

## Current Status

Information Alchemist is being transformed from a standalone application into a sophisticated CIM (Composable Information Machine) leaf node interface. This represents a major architectural shift that brings distributed capabilities, conceptual spaces, and AI readiness.

**ðŸŽ¯ Dog-Fooding Alert**: This progress tracking system will be one of the first graphs loaded into Information Alchemist itself, creating a self-referential system where the tool visualizes its own development journey!

### ðŸš§ Current Phase: Phase 0 - NATS Integration Foundation (Week 1)

We are currently implementing the foundation for NATS communication:

**Tasks**:
- [x] **NATS Client Setup** - âœ… COMPLETED
  - Integrated async-nats 0.41 with tokio runtime
  - Created NATS client wrapper with health checks
  - Implemented configuration with JetStream support
  - Fixed Bevy 0.16 dynamic linking issues

## Self-Referential Development

### The Dog-Fooding Journey

Information Alchemist will use itself to understand its own development:

1. **Progress Visualization**: The `progress.json` file will be loaded as a graph
2. **Git Integration**: Commit history will be transformed into graph events
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Development activities streamed through NATS
4. **Pattern Detection**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights to improve the tool itself

### Benefits of Self-Visualization

- **Immediate Feedback**: Test features on real, meaningful data
- **Living Documentation**: Interactive visualization of project evolution
- **Team Insights**: Understand collaboration patterns and velocity
- **Quality Improvement**: Detect issues early through pattern analysis

## Key Changes from Original Plan

### Architecture Evolution
- **From**: Local event sourcing with file storage
- **To**: Distributed event sourcing via NATS JetStream

### Communication
- **From**: Internal event bus
- **To**: NATS subjects for all backend communication

### Storage
- **From**: Local JSON files
- **To**: Distributed Event Store + Object Store

### Features
- **Added**: Conceptual spaces, game theory, AI readiness, dog-fooding
- **Enhanced**: Multi-user collaboration, distributed queries, self-analysis

## Progress Tracking

The progress is tracked in `progress.json` which can be loaded into Information Alchemist once the graph visualization is working. This creates a self-referential system where the tool tracks its own development.

### Viewing Progress

```bash
# View the progress graph structure
cat progress.json | jq .

# Once Information Alchemist is running:
# 1. Load progress.json as a graph
# 2. Visualize development timeline
# 3. Analyze phase dependencies
# 4. Track completion status
```
