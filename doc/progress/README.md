# Current Work in Progress

This directory should contain ONLY documentation for work that is currently in progress.

## Purpose

- Track ongoing implementation efforts
- Document current sprint/phase work
- Capture in-flight design decisions
- Record blockers and solutions

## Guidelines

1. **Start Progress Document**: When beginning new work, create a progress document
2. **Update Regularly**: Keep progress documents current during implementation
3. **Move When Complete**: Once work is done, move the document to `/doc/completed/`

## Current Work

**Active Work: Phase 5 Export Implementation**
- Document: [Phase 5 Import/Export Status](phase-5-import-export-status.md)
- Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Import done, Export missing
- Started: Phase started earlier, Export work needed now
- Estimated Completion: 1-2 weeks for full Phase 5 completion

### Current Status Summary:
1. ‚úÖ Phase 1-4: Complete with working tests
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 5: Import works, Export completely missing
3. ‚úÖ Phase 6: Test infrastructure fixed, 106/114 tests passing
4. üî• **Critical Gap**: Cannot save graphs - export functionality needed

### Key Findings:
- Import functionality exists but is limited (hardcoded file)
- No export/save capability at all
- No file dialog integration
- No round-trip data preservation
- Phase 5 cannot be considered complete without export

## Recently Completed Work

The following work was recently completed and moved to `/doc/completed/`:
- Phase 1-4 implementation (see completed directory)
- Test infrastructure fixes (Phase 6)

## Phase Status Overview

| Phase | Status | Implementation | Tests |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Phase 1: Core Graph | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Done | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Phase 2: Selection | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Done | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Phase 3: Storage | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Done | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Phase 4: Layout | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Done | ‚úÖ Pass |
| **Phase 5: Import/Export** | **‚ö†Ô∏è Partial** | **‚ö†Ô∏è Import only** | **‚ùå None** |
| Phase 6: Test Infra | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Done | ‚úÖ 106/114 |

## Document Format

Progress documents should include:
- **Goal**: What we're implementing
- **Approach**: How we're implementing it
- **Progress**: What's been done
- **Blockers**: Any issues encountered
- **Next Steps**: What remains

For completed work, see `/doc/completed/`
For implementation plans, see `/doc/plan/`
For project overview, see `progress-graph.md`
