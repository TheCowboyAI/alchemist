# CIM Subject Module Creation

## Date: January 2025

## Summary

Successfully created the `cim-subject` module to handle Subject Algebra for NATS-based domain routing and message translation. This module was extracted and enhanced from code that was previously in `cim-domain`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Module Structure
- Created `cim-subject` directory with proper Cargo.toml
- Added to workspace members in root Cargo.toml
- Set up module with proper dependencies (thiserror, serde, tokio, dashmap)

### 2. Implemented Core Components

#### Subject Types (`subject.rs`)
- `Subject` - A NATS subject representing a hierarchical address
- `SubjectParts` - Parsed components (context, aggregate, event_type, version)
- Methods for parsing, validation, and manipulation

#### Pattern Matching (`pattern.rs`)
- `Pattern` - Wildcard matching for subjects
- Support for NATS wildcards (`*` and `>`)
- Efficient matching algorithms

#### Subject Algebra (`algebra.rs`)
- `SubjectAlgebra` - Compositional operations on subjects
- Operations: Sequence, Parallel, Choice, Transform, Project, Inject
- `CompositionRule` and `Transformation` for custom operations
- `SubjectLattice` for partial ordering of subjects

#### Permissions (`permissions.rs`)
- `Permissions` - Subject-based access control
- `PermissionRule` - Pattern-based allow/deny rules
- Operations: Publish, Subscribe, Request
- Permission intersection and filtering

#### Parser (`parser.rs`)
- `SubjectParser` - Custom parsing rules by context
- `ParseRule` and `ValidationRule` for extensibility
- Builder pattern for easy configuration

#### Translator (`translator.rs`)
- `Translator` - Convert subjects between schemas
- `TranslationRule` - Pattern-based translation
- Bidirectional translation support
- `MessageTranslator` trait for generic message translation

### 3. Updated cim-domain
- Removed `subjects.rs` module
- Updated imports to use `cim-subject` crate
- Moved `PropagationScope` and `EventEnvelope` to `events.rs` (domain-specific)
- Fixed all compilation errors from the migration

### 4. Fixed Compilation Issues
- Removed `Debug` derives from structs containing function pointers
- Fixed method calls (using parentheses for getters)
- Added proper error conversions
- Fixed BevyCommand usage in bevy_bridge.rs

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Subject handling is now independent of domain logic
2. **Reusability**: Any module using NATS can now use cim-subject
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new parsing rules, transformations, and permissions
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing for subjects, patterns, and operations
5. **Performance**: Efficient pattern matching and caching

## Usage Example

```rust
use cim_subject::{Subject, Pattern, SubjectAlgebra, Permissions};

// Create a subject
let subject = Subject::new("people.person.created.v1")?;

// Pattern matching
let pattern = Pattern::new("people.*.created.>")?;
assert!(pattern.matches(&subject));

// Permissions
let perms = PermissionsBuilder::new()
    .allow("people.>", &[Operation::Subscribe])?
    .deny("*.*.deleted.>", &[Operation::Publish])?
    .build();

// Subject algebra
let algebra = SubjectAlgebra::new();
let composed = algebra.compose(&subject1, &subject2, AlgebraOperation::Sequence)?;
```

## Next Steps

1. Add benchmarks for pattern matching performance
2. Implement more sophisticated algebra operations
3. Add integration with NATS ACL system
4. Create examples demonstrating common use cases
5. Add property-based tests for algebra operations
