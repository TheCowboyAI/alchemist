# Phase 3 Visualization Progress

## Date: January 8, 2025

## Completed Today

### ConceptGraph Visualization Components âœ…

Successfully created the foundation for visualizing conceptual graphs in 3D space with quality dimensions.

#### Components Created

1. **ConceptualNodeVisual**
   - Visual representation of concept nodes
   - Support for different shapes (Sphere, Cube, Cone, etc.)
   - Customizable styling (color, emissive, scale, transparency)
   - Selection and hover states

2. **ConceptualEdgeVisual**
   - Visual representation of relationships
   - Support for different relationship types
   - Customizable edge styling (color, width, arrows, curves)
   - Animation progress tracking

3. **QualityDimensionAxis**
   - 3D representation of quality dimensions
   - Directional axes with colors
   - Scale factors for dimension mapping
   - Label support (to be implemented)

4. **ConceptualSpaceVisual**
   - Container for the entire conceptual space
   - Configurable bounds and origin
   - Grid visualization settings
   - Multiple quality dimensions support

5. **Interactive Components**
   - DraggableNode with constraints
   - ConnectableNode with allowed connections
   - SelectableGraph with multiple selection modes
   - TransitionAnimation with easing functions

#### Systems Implemented

1. **visualize_conceptual_nodes**
   - Maps concept nodes to 3D visual representations
   - Different shapes for different concept types
   - Smooth entry animations

2. **create_quality_dimension_axes**
   - Creates visual axes for each quality dimension
   - Color-coded with arrow heads
   - Configurable visibility

3. **create_conceptual_grid**
   - Creates grid plane for spatial reference
   - Configurable spacing and subdivisions
   - Transparent for better visibility

4. **animate_quality_dimensions**
   - Gentle rotation animation for axes
   - Helps with 3D perception

5. **update_transition_animations**
   - Smooth position transitions
   - Multiple easing functions
   - Configurable animation speed

6. **highlight_hovered_nodes**
   - Basic hover detection (needs improvement)
   - Visual feedback for interaction

#### Domain Model Updates

- Added `quality_position` field to all ConceptNode variants
- Added helper methods `id()` and `quality_position()` to ConceptNode
- Updated tests to include quality positions

#### Demo Example

Created `conceptual_graph_visualization_demo.rs` that demonstrates:
- 3D conceptual space with three quality dimensions (Complexity, Abstraction, Performance)
- Five example concepts positioned in the space
- Grid visualization for spatial reference
- Camera controls for viewing from different angles

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Domain model (ConceptNode) remains pure with just data
   - Visualization components are separate from domain
   - Systems bridge between domain and presentation

2. **Component Design**
   - Small, focused components following ECS principles
   - Composable visualization elements
   - Reusable animation and interaction components

3. **Quality Dimension Mapping**
   - Flexible mapping from n-dimensional conceptual space to 3D
   - Each dimension can map to any 3D direction
   - Scale factors allow dimension importance weighting

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 3-4 of Phase 3)

1. **Interactive Graph Manipulation**
   - Implement proper raycasting for node selection
   - Node dragging with constraints
   - Real-time position updates to domain model
   - Visual feedback during interaction

2. **Edge Creation UI**
   - Click-and-drag edge creation
   - Connection validation
   - Preview visualization
   - Relationship type selection

3. **Camera Controls**
   - Orbit camera around conceptual space
   - Zoom to selected nodes
   - Focus on regions of interest

### Coming Soon (Day 5+)

1. **Context Bridge Visualization**
   - Visual representation of cross-context relationships
   - Different styles for different mapping types
   - Flow animation for translations

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Node labels with text
   - Edge labels and annotations
   - LOD system for large graphs
   - Spatial indexing for performance

3. **UI Integration**
   - Tool palette for graph operations
   - Property inspector for selected items
   - Settings panel for visualization options

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Using instanced rendering for similar nodes (future optimization)
- Spatial indexing needed for large graphs
- LOD system for distant nodes

### Known Issues
- Hover detection needs proper raycasting implementation
- Text rendering for labels not yet implemented
- Need to add proper camera controls

### Dependencies
- Bevy 0.15.0 for ECS and rendering
- petgraph for graph structure (in domain)
- uuid for unique identifiers

## Summary

Phase 3 is off to a strong start with the core visualization components in place. The conceptual graph can now be visualized in 3D space with quality dimensions clearly represented. The architecture is clean and extensible, ready for the interactive features that will be added next.

The demo shows that concepts can be meaningfully positioned in a multi-dimensional quality space and visualized in an intuitive way. This forms the foundation for the interactive graph manipulation and domain model import features planned for the rest of Phase 3.
