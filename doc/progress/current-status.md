   - ConceptualSpaces Domain: 5D semantic reasoning
   - Identity Domain: Person/organization management
   - Location Domain: Geospatial data, hierarchical locations
   - Git Domain: Repository integration, commit tracking
   - Dialog Domain: Conversation tracking, context preservation
   - Policy Domain: Business rule enforcement
