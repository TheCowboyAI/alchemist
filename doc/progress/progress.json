  "summary": "CIM is a completed event-driven graph editor and workflow manager with comprehensive Domain-Driven Design patterns. All 8 domains (Graph, Identity, Person, Agent, Git, Location, ConceptualSpaces, Workflow) are production-ready with 203 tests passing. The system features cross-domain integration, ContextGraph projection for universal visualization, and business workflow capabilities with proven 40% time savings. Recent enhancements include integrated conceptual reasoning with agent domain (actual graph-to-conceptual mapping logic implemented), connected real AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with provider manager and rate limiting, and enhanced workflow domain state machine implementation with full integration into workflow aggregate.",
