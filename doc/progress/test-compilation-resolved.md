# Test Compilation Issues Resolved

## Summary

Successfully resolved the experimental occlusion culling linking issues that were blocking test compilation in Bevy 0.16.0.

## Problem

Tests were failing to compile with linker errors related to experimental occlusion culling components:
- `ViewDepthTexture` component registration missing
- `OcclusionCullingSubview` component registration missing

These symbols were part of experimental features in Bevy 0.16.0 that caused linking issues even when not directly used.

## Solution

1. **Upgraded Bevy to main branch** (commit hash from GitHub)
   - The main branch had fixes for these experimental features
   - Updated both `bevy` and `bevy_egui` to use git sources

2. **Created minimal test configuration**
   - Used `MinimalPlugins` instead of `DefaultPlugins` for tests
   - Avoided pulling in render-related dependencies

3. **Built custom Nix test runner**
   - Created `nix/test-runner-build.nix` using `buildRustPackage`
   - Configured with proper Vulkan support and environment variables
   - Set `BEVY_HEADLESS=1` for CI/testing environments

## Results

- ✅ All 114 tests now compile successfully
- ✅ 106 tests passing
- ❌ 8 tests failing (actual test logic issues, not compilation)
- ✅ Test framework ready for TDD development

## Key Files Modified

1. `Cargo.toml` - Updated Bevy dependencies to use git main branch
2. `src/test_config.rs` - Created minimal test configuration module
3. `nix/test-runner-build.nix` - Custom Nix test runner
4. Various test files - Updated to use new Bevy APIs

## Lessons Learned

1. Experimental features in stable releases can cause unexpected linking issues
2. Using development branches can sometimes be necessary to resolve critical blockers
3. MinimalPlugins is the preferred approach for headless testing in Bevy
4. Nix provides excellent isolation for complex build environments

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 8 failing tests (test logic issues)
2. Add more test coverage for new features
3. Consider pinning to a specific Bevy commit for stability
4. Monitor Bevy releases for when these fixes land in stable
