# Fresh Start - January 2025

## Summary

We have successfully archived the old `/src` directory and created a clean slate for rebuilding IA from the ground up.

## What Was Done

1. **Archived Old Code**
   - Moved entire `/src` directory to `/doc/archive/2025-01-src-legacy/`
   - Created README documenting the archive
   - Preserved all code for future reference

2. **Clean Slate Setup**
   - Minimal `main.rs` with just Bevy (no NATS plugin yet)
   - Minimal `lib.rs` that re-exports cim modules
   - Removed references to non-existent binaries from Cargo.toml

3. **Current State**
   - Main application runs: `cargo run --bin ia`
   - Shows a simple 3D scene with green plane
   - Ready to build up incrementally

## Working Foundation

The following modules are tested and ready to build upon:
- **cim-domain**: 192 tests passing
- **cim-contextgraph**: 31 tests passing
- **cim-ipld**: 14 tests passing
- **graph-composition**: 14 tests passing

Total: 251+ tests passing

## Next Steps

1. Start integrating cim-contextgraph functionality into main app
2. Add basic graph visualization using Bevy
3. Gradually add domain concepts from cim-domain
4. Build up NATS integration when needed
5. Focus on incremental, working demos at each step

## Key Decision

Rather than trying to fix the complex integrated system, we're building from the bottom up with working components at each stage. This ensures we always have a running system and can validate our architecture decisions incrementally.
