- Unified NATS subject naming patterns
- Standard environment variable conventions

### Completeness
- Architecture sections with aggregate definitions
- Command and event catalogs
- Integration points documented
- Usage examples with real code
- Testing instructions
- Migration guides where applicable

### Technical Depth
- Average sections per README: 18.5
- Code examples per README: 8-12
- Cross-domain integration documented
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security considerations included

## Coverage Improvement

| Metric                    | Day 1 Start | Day 1 End | Day 2 End | Target    |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Modules with README       | 1 (9%)      | 4 (36%)   | 8 (73%)   | 11 (100%) |
| Total Documentation Lines | 195         | 1,070     | 2,720     | 3,500+    |
| Average Lines per README  | 195         | 267       | 340       | 350+      |

## Remaining Modules

Still need README documentation:
1. **cim-domain-person** (30% test coverage)
2. **cim-domain-policy** (40% test coverage)
3. **cim-domain-graph** (60% test coverage)

## Next Steps

### Day 3 Tasks:
1. Create README for remaining 3 modules
2. Create architecture overview documentation
3. Update main project README with module descriptions
4. Create getting started guide

### Quality Improvements:
- Add diagrams to existing READMEs
- Create cross-reference index
- Add troubleshooting sections
- Include performance benchmarks

## Observations

### Strengths:
- Comprehensive coverage of domain concepts
- Rich code examples demonstrating usage
- Clear integration patterns documented
- Consistent structure aids navigation

### Areas for Enhancement:
- Need visual diagrams for complex concepts
- Could add more error handling examples
- Performance tuning guides could be expanded
- More cross-domain workflow examples needed

## Time Investment

- Day 2 Duration: ~3 hours
- Average time per README: 45 minutes
- Total documentation created: 1,650 lines
- Productivity: 550 lines/hour

## Conclusion

Day 2 successfully expanded documentation coverage to 73% of domain modules. The documentation quality remains high with comprehensive coverage of each domain's concepts, architecture, and usage patterns. The consistent structure and rich examples provide a solid foundation for developers working with the CIM system.

Ready to proceed with Day 3 tasks to achieve 100% module documentation coverage and create overarching architectural documentation.
