# Design Compliance Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the current state of our DDD-compliant design and implementation for the Information Alchemist project.

## Current Status

### ✅ Implementation: 100% DDD-Compliant

Our codebase in `src/` is fully compliant with all DDD naming conventions:
- **Events**: Past-tense facts without "Event" suffix (GraphCreated, NodeAdded)
- **Services**: Verb phrases revealing intent (CreateGraph, AnimateGraphElements)
- **Storage**: Plural domain terms (Graphs, Nodes, Edges)
- **Components**: Domain-specific names (GraphMotion, NodePulse)
- **No technical suffixes**: No Repository, Manager, Handler, etc.

### ✅ Design Documentation: Fully Updated

The authoritative design documents in `/doc/design/` are 100% DDD-compliant:
- **graph-domain-design.md**: Complete domain model with pure business language
- **graph-current-state-analysis.md**: Accurate reflection of current implementation
- **graph-implementation-roadmap.md**: Feature-focused development plan
- **README.md**: Clear visual examples and naming guidelines

## Document Hierarchy

### Authoritative Sources (Use These)

1. **Implementation**: `src/` - The actual running code
2. **Design**: `/doc/design/` - Current DDD-compliant design
3. **Vocabulary**: `/doc/publish/vocabulary.md` - Domain glossary

### Historical Documents (For Reference Only)

1. **Plan**: `/doc/plan/` - Original planning documents (may have naming inconsistencies)
2. **Research**: `/doc/research/` - Background research and exploration

## Key Naming Examples

### ✅ Correct (What We Use)

```rust
// Events (past-tense facts)
pub struct GraphCreated { ... }
pub struct NodeAdded { ... }
pub struct EdgeConnected { ... }

// Services (verb phrases)
pub struct CreateGraph;
pub struct FindGraphPaths;
pub struct AnimateGraphElements;

// Storage (plural terms)
pub struct Graphs;
pub struct GraphEvents;
pub struct Nodes;

// Components (domain-specific)
pub struct GraphMotion { ... }
pub struct NodePulse { ... }
```

### ❌ Incorrect (What We Avoid)

```rust
// Technical suffixes
GraphCreatedEvent      // Don't add "Event"
GraphRepository        // Use "Graphs" instead
LayoutEngine          // Use verb phrase like "ApplyGraphLayout"
GraphManager          // Use specific verb phrase
NodeEntity            // Just use "Node"
EdgeDTO               // Use domain term
```

## Bounded Contexts

Our implementation has two clean contexts:

1. **Graph Management** (Core Domain)
   - Manages graph lifecycle and structure
   - Services: CreateGraph, AddNodeToGraph, ConnectGraphNodes
   - Storage: Graphs, GraphEvents, Nodes, Edges

2. **Visualization** (Supporting Domain)
   - Handles display and interaction
   - Services: RenderGraphElements, AnimateGraphElements
   - Components: GraphMotion, NodePulse

## Migration Notes

If you encounter older documents with non-compliant naming:
1. The implementation in `src/` is the source of truth
2. Refer to `/doc/design/` for correct patterns
3. Do not update historical documents - they serve as project history
4. All new code must follow DDD conventions

## Quick Compliance Check

When reviewing code or documentation:

| Element | Check For | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Events | Past-tense, no suffix | `GraphCreated` ✅ |
| Services | Verb phrase | `CreateGraph` ✅ |
| Storage | Plural noun | `Graphs` ✅ |
| Entities | Singular noun | `Node` ✅ |
| Components | Domain term | `GraphMotion` ✅ |

## Conclusion

- **Our implementation is 100% DDD-compliant** ✅
- **Design documents in `/doc/design/` are authoritative** ✅
- **Use these as reference for all new development** ✅
- **Historical documents preserved for project history** ✅

The architecture is clean, consistent, and ready for continued feature development following these established patterns.
