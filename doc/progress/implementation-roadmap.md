## Key Technology Decisions

### Immediate Decisions Needed
1. **Vector Database**: Qdrant vs Weaviate vs Pinecone
2. **Deployment Platform**: AWS vs GCP vs Self-hosted
3. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus/Grafana vs DataDog vs New Relic

### Architecture Principles
- Event-driven architecture (maintained)
- Domain-driven design (maintained)
- CQRS pattern (maintained)
- Zero CRUD operations (maintained)
- Process isolation for renderers
- Microservice-ready but monolith-first

### Performance Targets
- Event processing: 1M+ events/sec
- Query response: <10ms p99
- Startup time: <1 second
- Memory per domain: <100MB

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage: >95%
- Warning count: 0
- Build time: <1 minute
- Deploy time: <5 minutes

### Business Metrics
- Time to value: <1 hour
- User productivity: 40%+ improvement
- System reliability: 99.9% uptime
- Support tickets: <10/month

### User Experience Metrics
- First interaction: <5 seconds
- Learning curve: <1 day
- Feature discovery: >80%
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5

## Resource Requirements

### Team Structure
- 2 Backend Engineers (Rust, Event Systems)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (Bevy, UI/UX)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (NixOS, NATS)
- 1 Product Manager
- 1 Technical Writer

### Infrastructure
- Development: 3 servers (NixOS)
- Staging: 3 servers (NixOS)
- Production: 6 servers (NixOS, HA)
- NATS Cluster: 3 nodes
- Vector DB: 3 nodes

### Budget Estimates
- Infrastructure: $5k/month
- Tools & Services: $2k/month
- Third-party APIs: $1k/month
- Total: $8k/month
