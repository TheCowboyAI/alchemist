# Graph Component Implementation Progress

**Date**: 2025-11-31
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation (Sprint 1-2)
**Status**: âœ… Core Graph Components Complete

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Graph Component Architecture
- [x] Created modular graph domain structure (`src/graph/`)
- [x] Implemented core components following DDD principles:
  - `Graph` aggregate root with identity (`GraphId`)
  - `GraphMetadata` for graph-level properties
  - `GraphNode` and `NodeId` for vertices
  - `GraphEdge` and `EdgeId` for connections
  - `ElementState` for visual states

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- [x] Defined comprehensive domain events:
  - Graph lifecycle: `GraphCreatedEvent`, `GraphMetadataUpdatedEvent`, `GraphDeletedEvent`
  - Node operations: `NodeAddedEvent`, `NodeUpdatedEvent`, `NodeRemovedEvent`
  - Edge operations: `EdgeCreatedEvent`, `EdgeUpdatedEvent`, `EdgeRemovedEvent`
  - Interactions: Selection, dragging, and batch operations
- [x] All events properly registered in Bevy

### 3. Graph Plugin Integration
- [x] Created `GraphPlugin` for Bevy integration
- [x] Event registration and system setup
- [x] Example graph creation on startup

### 4. Visual Representation
- [x] Nodes render as blue spheres (0.5 radius)
- [x] Camera positioned for optimal graph viewing
- [x] Ambient and directional lighting configured
- [x] Ground plane for spatial reference

## Test Results

Successfully created and rendered example knowledge graph:
```
Graph: "Example Knowledge Graph" (domain: knowledge)
Nodes:
  - Rust: Technology at (-5, 0, 0)
  - Bevy: Framework at (5, 0, 0)
  - ECS: Pattern at (0, 5, 0)
Edges:
  - Bevy implements Rust
  - Bevy uses ECS
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Graphs as Aggregates**: Treating graphs as first-class entities with their own identity and metadata, not just collections of nodes/edges
2. **Event-First Design**: All graph modifications happen through events, enabling:
   - Event sourcing capabilities
   - NATS integration readiness
   - Complete audit trail
3. **ECS Component Separation**: Clear separation between domain model and visual representation
4. **Modular Structure**: Graph functionality isolated in its own module for maintainability

## Next Steps (Sprint 3-4)

1. Implement edge rendering (lines between nodes)
2. Add camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom)
3. Implement node selection and highlighting
4. Add property inspector UI with egui
5. Connect to NATS for event persistence

## Technical Notes

- Using Bevy 0.16's new `EventWriter::write()` API
- Sphere meshes for nodes (may switch to instanced rendering for performance)
- Ready for Merkle DAG integration per research notes
