# Location Domain Extraction Complete

## Summary
Successfully extracted the location domain from `cim-domain` into a separate submodule `cim-domain-location`.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Directory Structure
- Created proper DDD structure with subdirectories:
  - `aggregate/` - Contains Location aggregate
  - `commands/` - Contains DefineLocation command
  - `events/` - Contains LocationDefined event
  - `handlers/` - Contains LocationCommandHandler
  - `value_objects/` - Contains Address, GeoCoordinates, VirtualLocation
  - `domain_events/` - Contains LocationDomainEvent enum

### 2. Moved Files
- Extracted location.rs from cim-domain to aggregate/location.rs
- Extracted DefineLocation command from cim-domain/src/commands.rs
- Extracted LocationDefined event from cim-domain/src/events.rs
- Extracted LocationCommandHandler from cim-domain/src/command_handlers.rs
- Created LocationDomainEvent enum wrapper for location events

### 3. Fixed Dependencies
- Added cim-domain as dependency (for CQRS types)
- Updated all imports to use cim_domain instead of cim_core_domain
- Fixed CommandHandler trait (not async)
- Fixed CommandAcknowledgment fields (uses `reason` not `message`)

### 4. Git Submodule Setup
- Initialized as git repository
- Added as submodule linked to https://github.com/thecowboyai/cim-domain-location
- Created initial commit

### 5. Cleaned Up cim-domain
- Removed location module from lib.rs
- Removed location commands from commands.rs
- Removed location events from events.rs and domain_events.rs
- Removed LocationCommandHandler from command_handlers.rs
- Removed location queries from query_handlers.rs
- Removed location tests from command_handlers.rs and query_handlers.rs

## Test Results
All 6 tests pass:
- 4 unit tests in src/lib.rs
- 2 integration tests in tests/location_tests.rs

## Technical Details
- LocationDomainEvent created for domain-specific events
- Event publishing temporarily disabled (TODO: implement proper event publishing)
- All location functionality preserved including:
  - Physical locations with addresses and coordinates
  - Virtual locations on various platforms
  - Logical locations for organizational structures
  - Hierarchical location relationships
  - Distance calculations between coordinates

## Next Steps
- Implement proper event publishing for location domain
- Consider moving LocationId to cim-core-domain
- Add more location-specific queries and projections
