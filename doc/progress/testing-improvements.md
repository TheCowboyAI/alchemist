# Testing Improvements Progress

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Enhancement (Completed)

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure following DDD principles and TDD practices.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. **Event Validation Framework**
- Created `event_validation_helpers.rs` with domain-specific test builders
- Implemented fluent API for event expectation testing
- Added comprehensive event validation across all contexts

#### 2. **Repository Integration Testing**
- Created `repository_integration_tests.rs` for cross-context testing
- Implemented integration tests for graph-agent communication
- Added tests for agent capabilities and knowledge management

#### 3. **Visualization Testing and Fixes**
- Fixed edge type switching issues in visualization services
- Properly implemented `update_existing_edges` to clean up old visuals
- Added comprehensive tests for all edge types (Line, Cylinder, Arc, Bezier)
- Fixed entity dereference issues and removed unused imports

### Technical Improvements

#### Fixed Issues:
1. **Edge Type Switching**: Previously, switching edge types left visual artifacts. Now properly:
   - Despawns all child entities for Arc and Bezier edges
   - Removes all visual components before re-rendering
   - Supports clean transitions between all edge types

2. **Compilation Errors**:
   - Fixed entity dereference issues (`*child` to `child`)
   - Removed unused imports (`Indices`, `PrimitiveTopology`, `RenderAssetUsages`)
   - Added missing `update_existing_edges` function to `UpdateVisualizationState`

#### Test Coverage Added:
- Graph management context tests
- Visualization services tests
- Event validation patterns
- Repository integration patterns

### Code Quality Improvements
- All tests follow DDD naming conventions
- Tests are domain-focused without framework dependencies
- Proper separation of unit and integration tests
- Event-driven test patterns established

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Expand Test Coverage
- [ ] Add tests for agent interaction patterns
- [ ] Implement tests for knowledge graph operations
- [ ] Create tests for NATS messaging integration
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

### Phase 3: Test Automation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD test pipeline
- [ ] Add mutation testing
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for domain invariants
- [ ] Create test coverage reports

## Lessons Learned

1. **Event-Driven Testing**: Creating a fluent API for event expectations significantly improves test readability
2. **Visualization Complexity**: Edge rendering with multiple types requires careful cleanup of components
3. **Type Safety**: Bevy's ECS provides good type safety but requires attention to reference types
4. **DDD in Tests**: Following DDD principles in tests improves maintainability and clarity

## Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 7
- **Test Helpers Added**: 2
- **Issues Fixed**: 3 major compilation/runtime issues
- **Edge Types Supported**: 4 (Line, Cylinder, Arc, Bezier)
- **Test Patterns Established**: Event validation, Repository integration
