### ðŸ”„ Partially Implemented Domains (50-89% complete)

5. **cim-domain-workflow** (70% complete)
   - Tests: 26 passing (but many are placeholder "should panic" tests)
   - Status: Core structure implemented, needs real test implementations
   - Missing: Actual workflow execution logic

6. **cim-domain-policy** (70% complete)
   - Tests: 22 passing
   - Status: Policy structure implemented
   - Missing: Policy evaluation engine

7. **cim-domain-location** (70% complete)
   - Tests: 23 passing
   - Status: Basic location management working
   - Missing: Advanced geographic calculations

8. **cim-domain-conceptualspaces** (60% complete)
   - Tests: 25 passing (includes placeholder tests)
   - Status: Core mathematical framework implemented
   - Missing: Full semantic reasoning capabilities

9. **cim-domain-document** (50% complete)
   - Tests: 5 passing
   - Status: Basic document management
   - Missing: Content extraction, versioning

10. **cim-domain-organization** (50% complete)
    - Tests: 7 passing
    - Status: Basic organization structure
    - Missing: Hierarchies, roles, permissions

### ðŸš§ Early Implementation Domains (<50% complete)

11. **cim-domain-agent** (40% complete)
    - Tests: 5 passing
    - Status: Foundation for AI agents
    - Missing: Agent behaviors, tool integration

12. **cim-domain-person** (30% complete)
    - Tests: 0 visible (likely embedded in identity domain)
    - Status: Basic person entity
    - Missing: Contact management, relationships

13. **cim-domain-dialog** (20% complete)
    - Tests: 0 passing
    - Status: Structure only
    - Missing: Conversation tracking, message handling

14. **cim-domain-bevy** (20% complete)
    - Tests: 0 visible
    - Status: Bevy integration layer
    - Missing: Comprehensive ECS mappings

## Actual Project Completion: ~65%

### By Category:
- **Core Domains** (Graph, Identity, Git): 93% complete
- **Business Domains** (Workflow, Policy, Document): 63% complete
- **AI/Semantic Domains** (ConceptualSpaces, Agent, Dialog): 40% complete
- **Support Domains** (Location, Organization, Person, Nix): 61% complete
- **Integration** (Bevy): 20% complete

## Critical Missing Components

1. **Event Choreography**: Cross-domain event flow not fully implemented
2. **NATS Integration**: Not all domains publish to NATS
3. **Projections**: Many domains lack read model projections
4. **Integration Tests**: Cross-domain integration tests missing
5. **Performance Testing**: No load testing or benchmarks

## Recommended Priority Order

1. **Complete Workflow Domain** - Critical for CIM vision
2. **Finish ConceptualSpaces** - Enables AI reasoning
3. **Implement Dialog Domain** - Needed for agent interactions
4. **Cross-Domain Integration** - Event choreography
5. **Performance Optimization** - Production readiness

## Abandoned/Superseded Work to Archive

Based on progress.json analysis, these appear to be abandoned:
- Early visualization attempts before ConceptGraph
- Initial state machine designs (superseded by workflow domain)
- Original subgraph implementations (replaced by current approach)
