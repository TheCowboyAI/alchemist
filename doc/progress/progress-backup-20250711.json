  "summary": "CIM is a completed event-driven graph editor and workflow manager with comprehensive Domain-Driven Design patterns. All 14 domains are production-ready. Recent major enhancement: Created Alchemist shell application for controlling AI models, dialogs, policies, and CIM deployments. Implemented hybrid renderer architecture supporting both Bevy (3D) and Iced (2D) windows. Added RSS feed management system with NLP enrichment (sentiment analysis, entity extraction, keywords) that streams through NATS JetStream. Updated cim-domain-agent to use Bevy v0.16.1 with full compatibility fixes.",
