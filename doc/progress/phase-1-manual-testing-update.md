# Phase 1 Manual Testing Update - In Progress

## Goal
Update the Phase 1 manual testing checklist with exact step-by-step instructions and verify what functionality actually exists vs what is documented.

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Started: Today
Estimated Completion: Today

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Manual Testing Checklist Update ✅
- Updated `/doc/plan/phase-1-manual-testing-checklist.md` with:
  - Exact key presses (M, P, W, B for render modes)
  - Exact key presses (1, 2, 3, 4 for edge types)
  - Precise mouse actions for selection
  - Clear warnings about features that may not work
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Expected vs Actual behavior table

### 2. Functionality Verification ✅
Analyzed codebase to determine what's actually implemented:

**Working Features:**
- Basic rendering with example graph (3 nodes, 2 edges)
- Keyboard controls for render modes (M, P, W, B)
- Keyboard controls for edge types (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Camera orbit controls (Left/Right arrows only)
- Mouse selection (left click to select, right click to deselect all)
- Edge animations (30% of edges get random animations)

**Not Working/Missing:**
- No UI for creating new graphs (only example graph)
- No UI for adding nodes or edges
- Point Cloud render mode (changes internally but no visual difference)
- Arc and Bezier edge types (may just show as cylinders)
- Automatic graph rotation (requires manual component addition)
- Node pulse animations (requires manual component addition)
- Up/Down camera controls
- Zoom/pan controls

### 3. Building and Testing ✅
- ✅ Fixed formatting issues with `nix fmt`
- ✅ Ran `nix flake check` successfully
- ✅ Built application with `nix build`
- ✅ Binary available at `result/bin/ia`
- [ ] Need to run the app and verify all documented features

## Current Task

### Manual Testing
Ready to run through the updated checklist:
1. Run `nix run` or `./result/bin/ia`
2. Follow the exact instructions in `/doc/plan/phase-1-manual-testing-checklist.md`
3. Document which features work vs don't work
4. Take notes on any unexpected behavior

## Blockers
None - ready for manual testing

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** and test each feature
2. **Document findings** - create a test results document
3. **Create issues** for any broken functionality
4. **Update progress documents** to reflect current state
5. **Make decision** on Phase 1.5 fixes vs moving to Phase 2

## Notes

- Headless tests cover the business logic well but can't verify visual features
- Many keyboard/mouse controls are implemented in code but may not be fully wired up
- The manual testing checklist is now a reliable source of truth for what should work
- Build completed successfully, producing a 98MB binary

## Files Modified
- `/doc/plan/phase-1-manual-testing-checklist.md` - Complete rewrite with exact instructions
- `/doc/progress/README.md` - Updated to reflect current work
- `/doc/progress/progress-graph.md` - Created visual progress timeline
