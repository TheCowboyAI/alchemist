# Phase 1: Edge Visualization Progress

## Goal
Implement visual representation of edges between nodes in the graph, responding to EdgeConnected events.

## Approach
Following the incremental implementation plan, we're adding edge visualization one component at a time:
1. Create edge rendering service
2. Add edge visual components
3. Connect to existing event system

## Progress
- [ ] Component 1.1: Edge Rendering Service
  - [ ] Create RenderGraphEdges service
  - [ ] Implement render_edge method
  - [ ] Add visualize_new_edges system
- [ ] Component 1.2: Edge Components
  - [ ] Add EdgeVisual component
  - [ ] Create EdgeVisualBundle
  - [ ] Integrate with Bevy's rendering

## Current Status
**Not Started** - This is the immediate next priority after QA report completion.

## Success Criteria
- Edges render as lines between nodes
- Edge color differs from nodes (e.g., white/gray vs blue nodes)
- System responds to EdgeConnected events
- Performance remains at 60 FPS

## Implementation Notes
```rust
// Planned structure for edge rendering
pub struct RenderGraphEdges;

impl RenderGraphEdges {
    pub fn render_edge(
        commands: &mut Commands,
        meshes: &mut ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
        materials: &mut ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,
        source_pos: Vec3,
        target_pos: Vec3,
        edge_entity: Entity,
    ) {
        // Create line mesh between positions
        // Apply edge material
        // Spawn visual entity
    }
}
```

## Blockers
None currently identified.

## Next Steps
1. Start implementation of RenderGraphEdges service
2. Test with existing example graph (3 nodes)
3. Ensure event handling works correctly
4. Move to Phase 2: Selection System
