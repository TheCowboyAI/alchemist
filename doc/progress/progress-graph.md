## Current Assessment

**Project Status**: Implementation mostly complete, but Phase 5 is only partially done.

### What We Have vs. What We Need

| Phase | Implementation | Testing | Status |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tests compile | ✅ DONE |
| **Phase 2** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tests compile | ✅ DONE |
| **Phase 3** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tests compile | ✅ DONE |
| **Phase 4** | ✅ Complete | ✅ Tests compile | ✅ DONE |
| **Phase 5** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No tests | ⚠️ INCOMPLETE |
| **Phase 6** | ✅ Complete | ✅ 106/114 pass | ✅ DONE |

- **JSON export functionality** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **File dialog integration** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Round-trip capability** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Multiple format support** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Test Coverage**: No tests written

### ✅ Phase 6: Test Verification
**Status: COMPLETE**
- [x] All tests compile successfully
- [x] Experimental occlusion culling linking issues resolved
- [x] Test runner configured with MinimalPlugins
- [x] 106 tests passing (8 failing due to test logic, not compilation)

## Missing Functionality for Phase 5 Completion

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Export Service** (`SerializeGraphToJson`)
   - No way to save graphs to JSON files
   - No export system or keyboard shortcuts
   - No file writing capability

2. **File Dialog Integration**
   - Import hardcoded to `assets/models/CIM.json`
   - No way to choose files for import/export
   - No native file browser integration

3. **Round-Trip Preservation**
   - Cannot export and re-import the same graph
   - No internal format definition
   - No data integrity validation

4. **Format Support**
   - Only supports one specific JSON schema
   - No support for GraphML, DOT, or other formats
   - No format conversion capabilities

## Action Items to Complete Phase 5

### Immediate Tasks (1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement GraphExporter service** (2-3 days)
   - Create `src/contexts/graph_management/exporter.rs`
   - Define internal JSON schema
   - Implement serialization logic

2. **Add Export System** (1 day)
   - Add Ctrl+S keyboard handler
   - Wire up export service
   - Add success/error feedback

3. **Integrate File Dialogs** (1 day)
   - Add `rfd` crate dependency
   - Implement file picker for import
   - Implement save dialog for export

4. **Test Round-Trip** (1 day)
   - Export a graph to JSON
   - Import the exported JSON
   - Verify data preservation

5. **Write Tests** (1-2 days)
   - Unit tests for import/export
   - Integration tests for file operations
   - Round-trip preservation tests

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **No Save Capability** | HIGH | CERTAIN | Implement export ASAP |
| **Data Loss** | HIGH | HIGH | No way to persist work |
| **Limited Import** | MEDIUM | CERTAIN | Add file dialog |
| **No Format Flexibility** | LOW | CERTAIN | Can add later |

## Project Readiness

### What's Ready
- ✅ Core graph functionality
- ✅ Selection and interaction
- ✅ Storage layer (in-memory)
- ✅ Layout algorithms
- ✅ Basic import from fixed file
- ✅ Test infrastructure

### What's Not Ready
- ❌ Export/save functionality
- ❌ File dialog integration
- ❌ Round-trip data preservation
- ❌ Multiple format support
- ❌ Phase 5 tests

## Recommendation

**DO NOT** consider the project feature-complete until Phase 5 export functionality is implemented. The inability to save work is a critical gap that makes the application unsuitable for real use.

**Priority**: Complete Phase 5 export functionality before moving to any new features.
