## Completed Phases

### ✓ Phase 1: Core Graph Foundation
- Graph, Node, Edge domain models
- Basic repositories and services
- Event-driven architecture
- Graph creation and manipulation

### ✓ Phase 2: Selection System
- Selection bounded context
- Multi-select with Shift/Ctrl
- Visual feedback (highlight colors)
- Keyboard controls (Esc, Ctrl+A)
- Integration with visualization

### ✓ Phase 3: Storage Layer with Daggy
- GraphStorage resource using Daggy
- Node and edge storage with indices
- Event synchronization services
- Load/save graph from storage
- Error handling and validation
- Verification system working

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 4: Persistence (Next)
