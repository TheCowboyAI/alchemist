## Current State Summary

### What's Working Well ✅
- **Architecture**: Clean DDD structure with bounded contexts
- **Core Features**: Basic graph visualization and interaction
- **Testing**: Comprehensive domain and ECS tests
- **Events**: Proper event-driven architecture

### What Needs Work ⚠️
- **Visual Modes**: Some render modes don't show visual changes
- **Edge Types**: Arc and Bezier may not render differently
- **UI**: No way to create graphs/nodes/edges in the app
- **Camera**: Limited to left/right orbit only

### Progress Metrics
- **Phase 1 Core**: 90% complete (missing some visual features)
- **Testing**: 100% for business logic, 0% for visuals
- **Documentation**: 95% complete (just updated manual testing)
- **Code Quality**: High - follows DDD principles

## Decision Point

After manual testing today, we need to decide:

1. **Option A**: Fix all Phase 1 gaps before moving to Phase 2
   - Pros: Complete feature set, better user experience
   - Cons: Delays advanced features

2. **Option B**: Move to Phase 2, fix gaps later
   - Pros: Progress on advanced features
   - Cons: Foundation has known issues

3. **Option C**: Fix critical gaps, defer nice-to-haves
   - Pros: Balanced approach
   - Cons: Need to define "critical"

The manual testing results will guide this decision.
