# Organization Domain Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## Overview

The Organization domain has been completely rewritten following proper Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and event-sourcing patterns. This domain manages organizational structures, hierarchies, and relationships within the CIM system.

## Architecture

The domain follows the standard CIM architecture:
- **Commands** express intent to change organizational state
- **Events** record what actually happened
- **Aggregates** enforce business rules and invariants
- **Projections** provide optimized read models
- **Handlers** process commands and queries

## Key Components Implemented

### Value Objects
1. **OrganizationType** - Company, Division, Department, Team, etc.
2. **OrganizationStatus** - Active, Inactive, Pending, Merged, Acquired, Dissolved, Archived
3. **RoleLevel** - Executive, VicePresident, Director, Manager, Lead, Senior, Mid, Junior, Entry, Intern
4. **OrganizationRole** - Comprehensive role management with permissions
5. **SizeCategory** - Startup, Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise, MegaCorp

### Commands
- CreateOrganization
- UpdateOrganization
- ChangeOrganizationStatus
- AddMember / RemoveMember / UpdateMemberRole
- ChangeReportingRelationship
- AddChildOrganization / RemoveChildOrganization
- AddLocation / RemoveLocation / ChangePrimaryLocation
- DissolveOrganization / MergeOrganizations / AcquireOrganization

### Events
- OrganizationCreated / Updated / StatusChanged
- MemberAdded / Removed / RoleUpdated
- ReportingRelationshipChanged
- ChildOrganizationAdded / Removed
- LocationAdded / Removed / PrimaryLocationChanged
- OrganizationDissolved / Merged / Acquired

### Business Rules Enforced
1. **Circular Reporting Prevention** - Prevents circular reporting relationships
2. **Status Transition Validation** - Only valid status transitions allowed
3. **Hierarchy Validation** - Prevents self-references and circular hierarchies
4. **Member Management** - Can't remove members with direct reports
5. **Dissolution Rules** - Can't dissolve organizations with child units

### Queries and Projections
- GetOrganizationById / GetOrganizationHierarchy
- GetOrganizationMembers / GetMemberOrganizations
- GetOrganizationsByType / GetOrganizationsByStatus
- GetReportingStructure / GetOrganizationChart
- SearchOrganizations / GetOrganizationStatistics

## Test Coverage

**Total Tests**: 37 (27 unit tests + 10 integration tests)
- All value objects tested
- Aggregate business rules tested
- Command and event handling tested
- Query handlers tested
- Comprehensive integration tests

## Key Features

1. **Hierarchical Organization Management**
   - Support for complex organizational structures
   - Parent-child relationships with validation

2. **Role-Based Member Management**
   - Predefined roles (CEO, CTO, Engineering Manager, etc.)
   - Custom role creation with permissions
   - Reporting relationships with circular detection

3. **Location Management**
   - Multiple locations per organization
   - Primary location designation

4. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Status transitions with validation
   - Dissolution with member disposition options
   - Merger and acquisition support

5. **Rich Querying**
   - Hierarchical views
   - Reporting structure visualization
   - Organization charts
   - Statistical analysis

## Integration Points

The Organization domain integrates with:
- **Person Domain** - For member information
- **Location Domain** - For physical locations
- **Identity Domain** - For authentication/authorization
- **Workflow Domain** - For organizational processes

## Next Steps

1. Integration with other domains
2. NATS event publishing for cross-domain communication
3. Performance optimization for large hierarchies
4. Advanced analytics and reporting
5. Real-time organization chart visualization in Bevy

## Code Quality

- Zero CRUD violations
- All operations through events
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented public API
