# Identity Domain ECS Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The Identity domain has been successfully refactored to use the ECS (Entity Component System) architecture, focusing on identity relationships and workflows while delegating specific details to other domains.

## Key Changes

### 1. Architecture Shift

**From**: Traditional DDD with aggregates and repositories
**To**: ECS-based with components, systems, and events

### 2. Domain Focus

The refactored Identity domain now focuses on:
- **Identity Lifecycle**: Creation, updates, merging, archiving
- **Relationships**: Managing connections between identities
- **Workflows**: Identity-related processes (verification, onboarding, etc.)
- **Projections**: Cross-domain representations

### 3. Clear Boundaries

Responsibilities delegated to other domains:
- **cim-domain-person**: Personal information (name, address, phone)
- **cim-domain-organization**: Organization structure and attributes
- **cim-domain-policy**: Authentication policies and authorization
- **cim-security**: Cryptographic operations
- **cim-keys**: Key management (SSH, GPG, API keys)
- **cim-bridge**: Cross-domain event translation

## New Components

### Identity Components
- `IdentityEntity`: Core identity with type and status
- `IdentityVerification`: Verification level and method
- `IdentityClaim`: Attributes with verification status
- `ExternalIdentity`: Links to external providers

### Relationship Components
- `IdentityRelationship`: Connections between identities
- `RelationshipRules`: Validation rules for relationships
- `RelationshipGraph`: Graph traversal configuration
- `RelationshipPath`: Cached paths for efficiency

### Workflow Components
- `IdentityWorkflow`: Active workflow instances
- `WorkflowStep`: Step definitions
- `WorkflowTransition`: State machine transitions
- `WorkflowHistory`: Completed workflow records

### Projection Components
- `IdentityProjection`: Cross-domain projections
- `CrossDomainReference`: References to other domains
- `IdentityView`: Context-specific views
- `ProjectionSyncStatus`: Synchronization tracking

## Systems Implemented

### Lifecycle Systems
- `create_identity_system`: Creates new identities
- `update_identity_system`: Updates identity status
- `merge_identities_system`: Merges duplicate identities
- `archive_identity_system`: Archives inactive identities

### Relationship Systems
- `establish_relationship_system`: Creates relationships
- `validate_relationship_system`: Validates against rules
- `traverse_relationships_system`: Graph traversal
- `expire_relationships_system`: Handles expiration

### Workflow Systems
- `start_workflow_system`: Initiates workflows
- `process_workflow_step_system`: Processes steps
- `complete_workflow_system`: Completes workflows
- `timeout_workflow_system`: Handles timeouts

### Projection Systems
- `create_projection_system`: Creates projections
- `sync_projections_system`: Synchronizes with other domains
- `validate_projections_system`: Validates projections

### Verification Systems
- `start_verification_system`: Starts verification
- `process_verification_system`: Processes results
- `complete_verification_system`: Completes verification
- `update_verification_claims_system`: Updates claims

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each domain has specific responsibilities
2. **No Duplication**: Eliminated overlap with person/organization domains
3. **Workflow Focus**: Identity domain is now the workflow orchestrator
4. **Relationship Hub**: Central point for managing identity relationships
5. **Performance**: ECS enables efficient batch processing
6. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new identity types or workflows
7. **Testability**: Each system can be tested independently

## Migration Strategy

The refactoring maintains backward compatibility by:
- Keeping legacy modules during migration
- Re-exporting legacy types
- Supporting existing error types
- Gradual migration path for dependent code

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for all systems
2. **Integration**: Update other domains to use new identity events
3. **Migration**: Gradually migrate legacy code to new architecture
4. **Optimization**: Profile and optimize system performance
5. **Documentation**: Create user guides for new workflows

## Example Usage

```rust
// Create an identity
commands.send(CreateIdentityCommand {
    identity_type: IdentityType::Person,
    initial_claims: Some(HashMap::from([
        (ClaimType::Email, "user@example.com".to_string()),
    ])),
    created_by: admin_id,
});

// Establish a relationship
commands.send(EstablishRelationshipCommand {
    from_identity: person_id,
    to_identity: org_id,
    relationship_type: RelationshipType::MemberOf {
        role: "Developer".to_string(),
        department: Some("Engineering".to_string()),
    },
    established_by: admin_id,
    metadata: json!({}),
});

// Start verification workflow
commands.send(StartWorkflowCommand {
    identity_id: person_id,
    workflow_type: IdentityWorkflowType::Verification,
    started_by: admin_id,
    context: json!({ "method": "email" }),
});
```

## Conclusion

The Identity domain refactoring successfully transforms it from a data-centric domain to a relationship and workflow-centric domain, eliminating duplication and establishing clear boundaries with other domains in the CIM architecture.
