# Graph Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap guides the implementation of the Information Alchemist Graph system following the DDD-compliant design.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Sprint 1: Graph Management Context

#### Tasks
1. **Domain Model Implementation**
   - Graph aggregate with GraphIdentity, GraphMetadata, GraphJourney
   - Node and Edge entities
   - Value objects (identities, positions, content)

2. **Storage Component**
   - Implement `Graphs` (plural storage pattern)
   - Daggy integration for graph structure
   - Index management for fast lookups

3. **Core Services**
   - `CreateGraph` - graph creation logic
   - `AddNodeToGraph` - node management
   - `ConnectGraphNodes` - edge management
   - `ValidateGraph` - business rules

4. **Domain Events**
   - `GraphCreated`, `NodeAdded`, `EdgeConnected`
   - Event metadata and correlation
   - Event store foundation

### Sprint 2: Event System & Persistence

#### Tasks
1. **Event Store Implementation**
   - Event storage by graph
   - Event replay capability
   - Projection support

2. **Event Topics**
   - Set up event routing
   - Implement topic naming (graphs.created, node.added, etc.)

3. **Basic Serialization**
   - JSON format for graphs
   - Import/export foundation

## Phase 2: Visualization (Week 3-4)

### Sprint 3: View System

#### Tasks
1. **View Aggregates**
   - GraphView with camera and selection state
   - 2D/3D perspective support

2. **Bevy Integration**
   - NodeReference and EdgeReference components
   - Sync system between Daggy and ECS
   - Basic 3D rendering

3. **Layout Service**
   - `ApplyGraphLayout` implementation
   - Force-directed algorithm
   - Position management

### Sprint 4: Interaction

#### Tasks
1. **Selection System**
   - `TrackNodeSelection` service
   - Multi-selection support
   - Selection visualization

2. **View Controls**
   - Camera movement
   - 2D/3D switching
   - Zoom and pan

3. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - `RenderGraphView` service
   - Edge visualization
   - Node styling

## Phase 3: Analysis & Import/Export (Week 5-6)

### Sprint 5: Analysis Context

#### Tasks
1. **Analysis Services**
   - `AnalyzeGraph` - general analysis
   - `FindGraphPaths` - pathfinding
   - `CalculateGraphMetrics` - metrics

2. **Algorithms**
   - Shortest path
   - Cycle detection
   - Centrality measures

### Sprint 6: Import/Export Context

#### Tasks
1. **Format Support**
   - `ImportGraphFormats` service
   - `ExportGraphFormats` service
   - JSON, Cypher, Mermaid formats

2. **Validation**
   - `ValidateImportFormat` service
   - Schema validation
   - Error handling

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

### Sprint 7: Animation Context

#### Tasks
1. **Timeline System**
   - Event timeline management
   - Playback controls

2. **Animation Services**
   - `ReplayGraphChanges`
   - `AnimateTransitions`
   - Interpolation system

### Sprint 8: Collaboration Context

#### Tasks
1. **Session Management**
   - Collaboration sessions
   - User presence

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - `CoordinateGraphSharing`
   - `ResolveConflicts`
   - Change synchronization

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Domain model invariants
   - Service logic
   - Event handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Cross-context communication
   - Event flow validation
   - Storage persistence

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete user scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

### Migration from Current Code

1. **Preserve Working Features**
   - Keep current 3D visualization
   - Maintain basic node spawning

2. **Gradual Migration**
   - Implement new design alongside
   - Switch systems one at a time
   - Validate at each step

## Success Metrics

- **Week 2**: Basic graph CRUD with events
- **Week 4**: Interactive 3D visualization
- **Week 6**: Import/export and analysis
- **Week 8**: Full feature set

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Daggy learning curve | Start with simple examples, prototype early |
| Event system complexity | Build incrementally, test thoroughly |
| Performance concerns | Profile early, optimize critical paths |
| Breaking changes | Feature flags, gradual rollout |

This roadmap ensures systematic implementation while maintaining DDD principles throughout the development process.
