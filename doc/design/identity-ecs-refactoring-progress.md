# Identity Domain ECS Refactoring Progress

## Status: 90% Complete (Compilation Errors Remain)

### What's Been Completed

1. **Component Architecture** ✅
   - Created modular component files (identity.rs, relationship.rs, workflow.rs, projection.rs)
   - Defined all core components with proper ECS derives
   - Established clear type aliases (IdentityId, RelationshipId, WorkflowId)

2. **System Implementation** ✅
   - Lifecycle systems (create, update, merge, archive)
   - Relationship systems (establish, validate, traverse, expire)
   - Workflow systems (start, process steps, complete, timeout)
   - Verification systems (start, process, complete)
   - Projection systems (create, sync, validate)

3. **Event-Driven Architecture** ✅
   - All operations go through commands and events
   - No direct mutations - everything is event-sourced
   - Proper event types for all domain operations

4. **Domain Aggregate** ✅
   - IdentityAggregate enforces business rules
   - Validation methods for all operations
   - Clear separation of concerns

5. **Query Operations** ✅
   - Read-only query functions
   - Projection support for optimized reads
   - Cross-domain reference handling

### Current Issues (10% Remaining)

1. **Field Name Inconsistencies**
   - Some code still references old field names (from_identity/to_identity vs source_identity/target_identity)
   - Need to update all references consistently

2. **Type Import Issues**
   - Some modules missing imports for types they use
   - Need to ensure all types are properly imported

3. **Workflow Structure Changes**
   - Old code references `current_state` field that no longer exists
   - Need to update to use direct fields on IdentityWorkflow

4. **Query Mutability Issues**
   - Some query functions trying to mutate World
   - Need to restructure for proper read-only access

### Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Clear Domain Focus**: Identity domain now focuses on relationships and workflows, not data storage
2. **ECS Performance**: Leverages Bevy's ECS for efficient queries and parallelization
3. **Event-Driven**: All state changes go through events, enabling audit trails and replay
4. **Modular Design**: Clear separation of components, systems, and queries
5. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Clean boundaries with other domains (person, organization, etc.)

### Next Steps

1. Fix remaining compilation errors
2. Add comprehensive tests for all systems
3. Create migration guide for existing code
4. Update documentation with usage examples
5. Performance benchmarking

### Migration Strategy

For teams using the old identity domain:

1. **Data Migration**: Create migration scripts to convert old data to new component structure
2. **API Compatibility**: Consider creating a compatibility layer for gradual migration
3. **Testing**: Extensive testing of migrated data and workflows
4. **Rollback Plan**: Keep old implementation available during transition period
