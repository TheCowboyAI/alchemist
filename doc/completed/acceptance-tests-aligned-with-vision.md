# Acceptance Tests Aligned with CIM Vision

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary

Updated the acceptance tests document to align with the broader CIM vision of being a comprehensive graph-based tool for DDD workflow modeling and AI-driven software development.

## Vision Statement

The CIM system enables users to:
- **Load** existing graphs from various sources (NATS, files, AI-generated)
- **Display** graphs with multiple visualization modes and conceptual mappings
- **Create** new graphs representing business domains and workflows
- **Model** DDD components and their relationships
- **Combine** multiple graphs through composition and morphisms
- **Apply** transformations and visualizations for different perspectives
- **Generate** software from domain models using AI agents

## Major Updates

### 1. Graph Loading and Persistence Tests
- Load graphs from event store with full reconstruction
- Import DDD models from YAML/JSON files
- Support for multiple graph sources

### 2. Graph Display and Visualization Tests
- Multiple visualization modes (DomainFlow, ConceptualSpace)
- Layered DDD visualization (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- Semantic clustering based on conceptual similarity

### 3. Graph Creation and Modeling Tests
- Interactive DDD component creation (Aggregates, Commands, Events)
- Workflow pattern templates (Saga, Process Manager, State Machine)
- Business rule modeling and validation

### 4. Graph Combination and Morphism Tests
- Compose multiple bounded contexts with context mapping
- Apply graph morphisms (abstraction, projection, transformation)
- Maintain context boundaries and integration points

### 5. AI-Driven Development Tests
- Generate code from domain models
- AI workflow optimization for efficiency
- Pattern recognition and application

### 6. Fitness Functions for Production
- Large graph performance (1000+ nodes at 60 FPS)
- Conceptual space accuracy (90%+ similarity matching)
- AI code generation quality (compilable, lintable code)

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (Milliseconds)
- Graph operations
- Morphism applications
- Layout algorithms
- Pattern matching

### Integration Tests (Seconds)
- Event store operations
- NATS communication
- File import/export
- Multi-graph composition

### AI Tests (Minutes)
- Code generation
- Workflow optimization
- Semantic analysis
- Pattern recognition

### Visual Tests (Manual)
- Rendering quality
- Animation smoothness
- Interaction responsiveness
- Layout aesthetics

## Success Criteria

1. **Graph Operations**: All CRUD operations < 10ms
2. **Visualization**: 60 FPS with 1000+ nodes
3. **AI Generation**: Valid code in < 30 seconds
4. **Semantic Accuracy**: 90%+ similarity matching
5. **Workflow Optimization**: 20%+ efficiency gains
6. **Memory Usage**: < 1GB for 10K node graphs
7. **Event Processing**: < 1ms per event
8. **Conceptual Mapping**: < 100ms for full graph

## Impact

The updated acceptance tests now provide comprehensive coverage for:
- The full graph lifecycle (load, display, create, model, combine, transform)
- DDD workflow modeling capabilities
- AI-driven development features
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Integration with the broader CIM ecosystem

This ensures that the system can serve as a powerful tool for designing DDD components and aligning them to real business domain workflows that AI agents can use to build software according to defined rules.
