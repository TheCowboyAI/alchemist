# IA-Specific Content Types Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented Information Alchemist specific content types using the external cim-ipld library, providing full CID support and TypedContent trait implementation for all domain objects.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Domain Content Types Module
- **Location**: `/src/domain/content_types/`
- **Purpose**: Define IA-specific content types that implement the TypedContent trait from cim-ipld

### 2. Content Type Implementations

#### GraphContent (0x300100)
- Complete graph structure with nodes and edges
- Support for conceptual space positioning
- HashMap-based edge storage for efficient lookups
- Methods for adding nodes/edges and setting conceptual positions

#### NodeIPLDContent (0x300101)
- Renamed from NodeContent to avoid conflicts with existing value objects
- Support for various node types (Standard, Concept, WorkflowStep, Decision, Integration)
- Conceptual coordinates for semantic positioning
- Custom properties storage with JSON values

#### EdgeIPLDContent (0x300102)
- Renamed from EdgeContent to avoid conflicts
- Support for various edge types (Directed, Bidirectional, Similarity, Dependency, Sequence, Conditional)
- Weight/strength values for connections
- Bidirectional edge reversal support

#### ConceptualSpaceContent (0x300103)
- Represents conceptual space structures
- Dimension definitions with ranges and cyclic support
- Points in conceptual space with entity mapping
- Distance calculation and similarity finding methods

#### WorkflowContent (0x300104)
- Workflow definitions with steps and transitions
- Various step types (Start, End, Process, Decision, Parallel, Join, Integration)
- Conditional transitions support
- Workflow validation capabilities

#### EventContent (0x300105)
- Wrapper for domain events with CID support
- Aggregate ID and sequence tracking
- Correlation and causation ID support
- Integration with ContentChain for event chaining

#### EventChainMetadata (0x300106)
- Metadata for tracking event sequences
- Genesis and head CID tracking
- Event count and timestamp tracking

### 3. Integration Points

- All types implement the `TypedContent` trait from cim-ipld
- Custom codec assignments in the CIM reserved range (0x300000-0x3FFFFF)
- Full serialization/deserialization support with serde
- CID generation using BLAKE3 hashing
- Comprehensive test coverage (14 tests, all passing)

### 4. Key Design Decisions

1. **Naming Conflicts Resolution**: Renamed NodeContent and EdgeContent to NodeIPLDContent and EdgeIPLDContent to avoid conflicts with existing value objects

2. **Modular Structure**: Each content type in its own module for maintainability

3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with enums for node types, edge types, and step types

4. **Extensibility**: Custom properties support on nodes and edges using HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>

5. **Chain Support**: EventContent designed to work with ContentChain from cim-ipld

## Testing

All content types have comprehensive tests covering:
- Creation and initialization
- CID generation
- Serialization/deserialization
- Type-specific functionality (e.g., bidirectional edges, workflow validation)

Test Results: **14 tests passed, 0 failed**

## Next Steps

With IA-specific content types complete, the next phase is:
1. Integrate NATS Object Store with cim-ipld for content-addressed storage
2. Create NatsObjectStore wrapper for content storage by CID
3. Implement content storage service with deduplication
4. Update event store to use CID chains from cim-ipld
