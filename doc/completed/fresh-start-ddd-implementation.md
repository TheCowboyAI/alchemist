# Fresh Start with DDD-Compliant Implementation

## Summary

We made the strategic decision to start fresh rather than refactor the existing codebase. This approach proved highly successful, resulting in a clean, DDD-compliant implementation from the ground up.

## Decision Rationale

### Why Fresh Start?
1. **Extensive Violations**: The legacy code had 40+ events with "Event" suffix
2. **Token Efficiency**: Clean code is easier for AI to work with
3. **No Legacy Debt**: No need to track conversion state
4. **Pure DDD from Start**: Every line follows our conventions
5. **Only ~738 lines**: Small enough to rebuild quickly

## What We Built

### 1. Clean Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â””â”€â”€ contexts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ graph_management/     # Core domain
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain.rs        # Entities, Value Objects
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ events.rs        # Domain events (no suffix!)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services.rs      # Services with verb phrases
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.rs
    â””â”€â”€ visualization/        # Supporting domain
        â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
        â”œâ”€â”€ services.rs      # Render services
        â””â”€â”€ plugin.rs
```

### 2. Domain Model (graph_management/domain.rs)
- **Value Objects**: GraphIdentity, NodeIdentity, EdgeIdentity, SpatialPosition
- **Entities**: Graph, Node, Edge
- **Bundles**: GraphBundle, NodeBundle, EdgeBundle
- All components properly structured for Bevy ECS

### 3. Domain Events (graph_management/events.rs)
All events are past-tense facts without "Event" suffix:
- `GraphCreated` (not GraphCreatedEvent)
- `NodeAdded` (not NodeAddedEvent)
- `EdgeConnected` (not EdgeCreatedEvent)
- `NodeRemoved`, `EdgeDisconnected`, `NodeMoved`
- `PropertyUpdated`, `LabelApplied`, `GraphDeleted`
- Subgraph events: `SubgraphImported`, `SubgraphExtracted`, `InterSubgraphEdgeCreated`

### 4. Domain Services (graph_management/services.rs)
Services use verb phrases that reveal intent:
- `CreateGraph` - Creates new graphs
- `AddNodeToGraph` - Adds nodes to graphs
- `ConnectGraphNodes` - Creates edges between nodes
- `ValidateGraph` - Validates graph operations

### 5. Visualization Services (visualization/services.rs)
- `RenderGraphElements` - Renders nodes and edges
- `HandleUserInput` - Processes user interactions
- `AnimateTransitions` - Handles animations
- `ControlCamera` - Manages camera movement

## Working Features

### âœ… Implemented
1. **Graph Creation**: Example graph with 3 nodes (Rust, Bevy, ECS)
2. **Node Visualization**: Blue spheres rendered in 3D space
3. **Event System**: Proper event flow from creation to visualization
4. **Camera Controls**: Arrow keys for orbit control
5. **Clean Architecture**: Bounded contexts properly separated

### ðŸš§ Ready for Implementation
1. **Edge Rendering**: Structure ready, just needs mesh generation
2. **Node Selection**: HandleUserInput ready for raycasting
3. **Graph Persistence**: Event store structure defined
4. **Import/Export**: Context structure prepared

## Code Quality

### DDD Compliance âœ…
- **No technical suffixes**: No Repository, Manager, System, Engine
- **Events as facts**: GraphCreated, NodeAdded (no "Event" suffix)
- **Service patterns**: Verb phrases like CreateGraph, AddNodeToGraph
- **Clear intent**: All names reveal business purpose

### Bevy 0.16 Compatibility âœ…
- Proper use of `Camera3d` instead of `Camera3dBundle`
- Correct `DirectionalLight` spawning
- Updated to use `EventWriter::write` instead of deprecated `send`
- Proper component insertion with `Mesh3d` and `MeshMaterial3d`

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Clean Event Flow
```rust
CreateGraph::execute()
  â†’ spawns entity
  â†’ emits GraphCreated

AddNodeToGraph::execute()
  â†’ spawns entity
  â†’ emits NodeAdded
  â†’ triggers RenderGraphElements::visualize_new_nodes()
  â†’ renders blue sphere
```

### 2. Proper Service Structure
```rust
// Service definition
pub struct CreateGraph;

impl CreateGraph {
    pub fn execute(...) -> GraphIdentity {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### 3. Event-Driven Visualization
- NodeAdded events automatically trigger visualization
- Clean separation between domain logic and rendering

## Metrics

| Metric | Old Code | New Code | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| DDD Violations | 40+ | 0 | 100% |
| Lines of Code | ~738 | ~750 | Similar size |
| Compilation | âœ… | âœ… | Maintained |
| Runtime | âœ… | âœ… | Working |

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Edge Rendering**
   - Add mesh generation for edges
   - Connect nodes visually

2. **Add Daggy Integration**
   - Implement Graphs storage with Daggy
   - Add graph algorithms

3. **Implement Selection**
   - Add raycasting to HandleUserInput
   - Highlight selected nodes

4. **Add 2D View**
   - Implement view mode switching
   - Add orthographic camera option

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fresh Start Was Right**: Much cleaner than refactoring
2. **DDD From Start**: Easier to maintain consistency
3. **AI Benefits**: Clean code is easier for AI to understand
4. **Bevy Evolution**: API changes require attention (Camera3dBundle â†’ Camera3d)

## Legacy Code Cleanup

- âœ… Moved old code to `src_legacy/` for reference
- âœ… Built new implementation from scratch
- âœ… Removed `src_legacy/` after confirming success
- âœ… Old code preserved in git history
