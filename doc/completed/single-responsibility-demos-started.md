# Single Responsibility Demos Implementation Started

**Date**: December 29, 2024
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Overview

Started implementing single responsibility demos that each focus on ONE specific feature, with Mermaid diagrams documenting the flow of each demo.

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each demo focuses on ONE specific feature
2. **Composable**: Demos can be combined to show workflows
3. **Domain Focused**: Organized by domain capability, not technology
4. **Self-Documenting**: Each demo includes Mermaid diagrams showing what happens
5. **Testable**: Each demo validates specific functionality

## Demos Implemented

### 1. `demo_nats_connection`
- **Purpose**: Verify NATS connection and health
- **Diagram Type**: Sequence diagram showing connection flow
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 2. `demo_event_persistence`
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve a single event
- **Diagram Type**: Sequence diagram showing event flow through CID chain
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 3. `demo_graph_create`
- **Purpose**: Create a simple graph through domain model
- **Diagram Type**: State diagram showing command processing
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

### 4. `demo_conceptual_space_create`
- **Purpose**: Create a conceptual space with quality dimensions
- **Diagram Type**: Flow chart showing dimension setup and concept mapping
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Mermaid Diagram Patterns

Each demo includes a Mermaid diagram in its documentation that visualizes:

1. **Sequence Diagrams**: For showing interaction between components
   - Used in: NATS connection, Event persistence

2. **State Diagrams**: For showing state transitions and processing
   - Used in: Graph creation (aggregate state changes)

3. **Flow Charts**: For showing data flow and transformations
   - Used in: Conceptual space (dimension → space → concepts)

## Example Output

### NATS Connection Demo
```
=== NATS Connection Demo ===
✓ Successfully connected to NATS
✓ NATS connection is healthy
--- Server Information ---
Server ID: ...
Version: ...
--- JetStream Status ---
✓ JetStream is enabled
```

### Event Persistence Demo
```
=== Event Persistence Demo ===
✓ Event stored successfully
Event CID: bafk...
✓ Retrieved 1 event(s)
✓ Event content verified
```

## Next Steps

### Remaining Phase 1 Demos
- [ ] `demo_cid_chain` - Show CID chain integrity
- [ ] `demo_event_replay` - Replay events from point in time

### Remaining Phase 2 Demos
- [ ] `demo_node_operations` - Node CRUD operations
- [ ] `demo_edge_operations` - Edge connections
- [ ] `demo_graph_validation` - Business rule enforcement
- [ ] `demo_workflow_create` - Workflow creation
- [ ] `demo_subgraph_create` - Subgraph operations

### Visualization Demos
- [ ] `demo_basic_visualization` - 3D graph rendering
- [ ] `demo_force_layout` - Physics-based layout
- [ ] `demo_animation_system` - Smooth transitions

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Easy to Test**: Each demo can be run independently
2. **Clear Documentation**: Mermaid diagrams show exactly what happens
3. **Incremental Verification**: Can verify features one at a time
4. **Composable**: Can combine demos to test workflows
5. **Debugging**: Focused demos make it easy to isolate issues

## Running the Demos

```bash
# Individual demo
cargo run --bin demo_nats_connection
cargo run --bin demo_event_persistence
cargo run --bin demo_graph_create
cargo run --bin demo_conceptual_space_create

# With NATS running
nats-server -js &
cargo run --bin demo_nats_connection
```

## Conclusion

The single responsibility demo approach provides a clear, testable way to verify that all Phase 1 and Phase 2 features are working correctly. Each demo is self-contained, well-documented with Mermaid diagrams, and can be composed into larger workflows.
