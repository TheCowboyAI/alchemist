# Phase 1.1 Event Sourcing Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Implemented

1. **Event Store Module** (`src/contexts/event_store/`)
   - Merkle DAG structure with CID-based content addressing
   - Append-only event storage with parent linking
   - Object store for content-addressed payloads
   - Aggregate index for efficient event retrieval

2. **Event Capture System**
   - Event adapter that converts graph events to domain events
   - Automatic capture of all graph operations:
     - GraphCreated
     - NodeAdded
     - EdgeConnected
     - NodeRemoved
     - NodeMoved
   - Integration with existing graph management systems

3. **Event Replay System**
   - Replay events from any point in the DAG
   - Reconstruct graph state from events
   - Support for both aggregate-based and CID-based replay

4. **Persistence Layer**
   - Save/load event store to/from disk
   - JSON serialization for debugging and inspection
   - Export DAG structure for visualization

5. **Bevy Integration**
   - EventStorePlugin for ECS integration
   - DomainEventOccurred event for processing
   - Logging system for monitoring events

### Key Design Decisions

- **Local-first**: Event store is separate from NATS with sync metadata
- **Content-addressed**: All events and payloads use CIDs for deduplication
- **Append-only**: Events are immutable once created
- **Merkle DAG**: Each event links to parents for audit trail integrity

### Current Limitations

1. **Placeholder CID**: Using a simple hash instead of proper multihash/IPLD
2. **No NATS sync**: Events are captured but not yet synced to NATS
3. **Limited replay**: Replay system exists but isn't fully integrated with UI

### Testing Status

- ✅ Unit tests for event store operations
- ✅ Integration tests for graph event capture
- ✅ Merkle DAG structure tests
- ⚠️  No UI tests for event visualization yet

### Next Steps

1. Implement proper CID library (multihash/IPLD)
2. Add NATS synchronization for events
3. Create UI for event history visualization
4. Add event filtering and querying capabilities
5. Implement event compaction/snapshotting

### Usage Example

```rust
// Events are automatically captured when graph operations occur
graph_created.send(GraphCreated { ... });

// The event is:
// 1. Converted to a DomainEvent by the adapter
// 2. Stored in the Merkle DAG with a CID
// 3. Logged by the monitoring system
// 4. Ready for replay or audit

// To replay events:
replay_events.send(ReplayGraphRequest { graph_id });
```

### Commits

1. `69e174a` - feat: implement Phase 1.1 - Event Sourcing with Audit Trail
2. `1bf4c42` - fix: complete event sourcing integration

The event sourcing foundation is now in place and ready for Phase 1.2 implementation.
