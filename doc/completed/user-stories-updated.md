# User Stories Updated for CIM Architecture

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Summary

Updated the user stories document to reflect the current state of the CIM (Composable Information Machine) implementation, aligning with our comprehensive test coverage and event-sourced architecture.

## What Was Updated

### 1. Restructured Around Core Architecture
- Reorganized stories to focus on Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Added stories for CID chain integrity and cryptographic verification
- Emphasized domain-driven design principles throughout

### 2. Added New Story Categories
- **Event Sourcing & CQRS Context**: Stories 1-3
- **Graph Domain Model Context**: Stories 4-7
- **Event Store & Infrastructure Context**: Stories 8-10
- **Integration & End-to-End Context**: Stories 11-13
- **Visualization & Presentation Context**: Stories 14-15
- **Content Types & IPLD Context**: Stories 16-17
- **Testing & Quality Assurance Context**: Stories 18-19
- **Performance & Scalability Context**: Story 20

### 3. Updated Test References
- Aligned all test references with actual implementation
- Referenced 90+ tests across domain, infrastructure, and integration layers
- Added specific test function names for traceability

### 4. Documented Current State
- 20 total user stories (down from 27, but more comprehensive)
- 95% fully implemented and tested
- 5% partially implemented (projections in progress)
- 0% not implemented

## Key Achievements Documented

1. **Event Sourcing**: Full implementation with CID chain integrity
2. **Domain Model**: Complete Graph aggregate following DDD principles
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing at all layers
4. **Infrastructure**: NATS JetStream integration working
5. **Content System**: IPLD-based content types with CID support

## Next Steps Identified

1. Implement projection infrastructure
2. Add query handlers for common patterns
3. Enhance visualization with semantic layout
4. Add conceptual space mapping
5. Implement AI agent interface

## Impact

The updated user stories now accurately reflect:
- The event-sourced nature of the system
- The importance of CID chains for integrity
- The comprehensive test coverage achieved
- The current implementation status
- Clear direction for future development

This update ensures that new developers and stakeholders can understand the system's capabilities and architecture through well-documented user stories that map directly to our test suite.
