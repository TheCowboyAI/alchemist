## How This Rule Works

When this rule is active, Cursor will understand the specialized requirements of NixOS development. This means:

1. **For Multi-File Edits**: Cursor will respect NixOS module patterns when suggesting edits across multiple files, maintaining proper imports and references[12].

2. **Background Agent Awareness**: When using the Background Agent feature, it will understand NixOS-specific tasks such as rebuilding configurations or debugging issues[12].

3. **Smarter Inline Edits**: The refreshed Inline Edit feature will suggest code completions aligned with Nix language patterns and NixOS configuration best practices[12].

4. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: When using @-folders to include entire directories, Cursor will parse NixOS module structures correctly[12].

5. **Workspace Integration**: Cursor will understand relationships between different NixOS configuration files across multi-root workspaces[12].

## Implementation Instructions

1. See `.cursor/rules/nixos.mdc`
2. Access Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+J) and verify the rule appears under "Project Rules"[7]
3. Enable the rule by ensuring it's checked in the settings

For global application across all NixOS projects, you can also add similar guidelines to your Global Rules in Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI[11].

## Benefits of This Rule

- **Consistent Code Generation**: All code generated by Cursor will follow NixOS conventions
- **Improved Understanding**: Cursor will recognize NixOS-specific terms and concepts
- **Better Assistance**: You'll receive more relevant suggestions for package management, services, and configuration
- **Reduced Errors**: The AI will avoid suggesting non-declarative approaches that don't work in NixOS
- **Time Savings**: Less time correcting AI-generated code to work properly in NixOS
