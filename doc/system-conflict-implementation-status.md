# System Conflict Analysis Implementation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of fixes identified in the system conflict analysis.

## Completed Items

### 1. System Execution Order with SystemSets ✅
- Created `GraphSystemSet` enum with proper phases:
  - Input
  - EventProcessing
  - StateUpdate
  - ChangeDetection
  - UI
  - RenderPrep
- Configured system sets to run in chain order
- Added camera system sets that run between Input and StateUpdate

### 2. Change Detection System ✅
- Created `GraphChangeFlags` resource to track frame-to-frame changes
- Implemented `update_change_flags` system that detects:
  - Node additions/changes/removals
  - Edge additions/changes/removals
  - View mode changes
  - Selection changes
- Added `reset_change_flags` system that runs in Last schedule

### 3. Run Conditions for Rendering Systems ✅
- Added run conditions to rendering systems:
  - `clear_rendering_on_view_change` runs only when `view_mode_changed`
  - `render_reference_grid` runs only when `view_mode_changed`
  - `render_graph_nodes` runs only when `nodes_changed`
  - `render_graph_edges` runs only when `edges_changed`

### 4. Proper System Ordering ✅
- Event processing systems run in dependency order
- Node events process before edge events
- Deferred edge events process after regular edge events
- UI systems run after all state updates
- Rendering systems run in PostUpdate

### 5. Panel System Consolidation ✅
- Removed duplicate `graph_inspector_ui` system from graph_core
- Created dedicated `AlgorithmPanel` for all algorithm functionality
- Simplified inspector panel to focus only on properties
- Removed algorithm tab from control panel
- Better separation of concerns between panels

## Updated Panel Architecture

### Control Panel (Left)
- View mode controls
- Graph patterns
- Creation tools
- File operations
- DDD/ECS domain tabs

### Inspector Panel (Right)
- Node/Edge properties display
- Selection state
- Quick actions (set as path source/target)
- Search and filtering
- Graph statistics

### Algorithm Panel (Floating/F6)
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Graph analysis tools
- Layout algorithms
- Results visualization
- Performance metrics

## Pending Items

### 1. Additional UI Improvements
- Properties panel for detailed editing
- Console panel for logs
- Minimap for large graphs
- Search panel for advanced queries

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Batch mesh updates for multiple changes
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) system
- Add frustum culling

### 3. Context-Based UI
- Implement context switching (Graph/DDD/ECS modes)
- Show/hide panels based on active context
- Workspace presets for different workflows

### 4. Testing
- Frame timing tests to verify execution order
- State consistency tests between systems
- Visual regression tests for flashing/artifacts
- Performance tests to measure system run frequency

## Known Issues Fixed

### 1. Rendering Flash on View Change ✅
- Rendering systems now only run when actual changes occur
- View mode changes properly trigger re-rendering

### 2. Event Timing Issues ✅
- Events are processed in proper dependency order
- Edges can no longer be created before their nodes exist

### 3. System Execution Order ✅
- Clear phases of execution prevent race conditions
- UI systems no longer fight for state

### 4. UI Panel Conflicts ✅
- No more duplicate inspector systems
- Clear separation between panel responsibilities
- Algorithm controls consolidated in one place

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining panels (properties, console, minimap)
2. Add context-based UI switching
3. Implement batch mesh updates for better performance
4. Create unit tests for system ordering
5. Add interactive node manipulation (drag, delete)
6. Implement edge creation UI

## Notes

The implementation follows the proposed architecture from the system conflict analysis document. The main improvements are:

1. **Predictable Execution Order**: Systems now run in well-defined phases
2. **Change Detection**: Only systems that need to run actually execute
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Rendering only updates when changes occur
4. **Reduced Conflicts**: Clear separation of concerns between system phases
5. **Clean UI Architecture**: No duplicate panels or conflicting systems

The application should now exhibit:
- No flashing when switching view modes
- Smooth transitions between 2D and 3D
- Consistent selection behavior
- Better overall performance
- Clear UI organization with dedicated panels
