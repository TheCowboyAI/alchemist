# Event Monitoring System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive event filtering and monitoring system has been implemented for Alchemist, providing real-time event tracking, historical analysis, and alerting capabilities.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Core Event Monitor Module
**File**: `src/event_monitor.rs`
- **EventMonitor**: Main monitoring service that subscribes to NATS
- **EventFilter**: Flexible filtering criteria structure
- **FilterExpression**: AST for the filtering DSL
- **EventStatistics**: Real-time statistics tracking
- **AlertRule**: Alert rule definitions with various actions
- **Database Integration**: SQLite storage with automatic indexing

Key Features:
- Async event processing with Tokio
- Automatic event persistence to SQLite
- Real-time statistics calculation
- Alert rule evaluation and triggering
- Event buffer for real-time monitoring

### 2. Shell Commands Integration
**File**: `src/shell_commands.rs`
- Added `EventCommands` enum with subcommands:
  - `List`: Show recent events with filters
  - `Watch`: Real-time event monitoring
  - `Query`: Query historical events with DSL
  - `Stats`: Display event statistics
  - `Export`: Export events to various formats
  - `Alert`: Manage alert rules

**File**: `src/shell.rs`
- Added `event_monitor` field to `AlchemistShell`
- Implemented `handle_event_command()` for processing event commands
- Added `handle_alert_command()` for alert management
- Integrated event monitor initialization with NATS

### 3. Renderer Integration
**File**: `alchemist-renderer/src/iced_renderer/event_monitor_view.rs`
- Created Iced-based UI for event monitoring
- Real-time event display with filtering
- Event detail inspection panel
- Auto-scroll and clear functionality
- Color-coded severity levels

**File**: `src/renderer.rs`
- Added `EventMonitor` variant to `RenderData` enum
- Implemented `spawn_event_monitor()` method

### 4. Main Application Updates
**File**: `src/main.rs`
- Added event_monitor module import
- Updated command handling to support event commands

### 5. Dependencies
**File**: `Cargo.toml`
- Added `regex` for pattern matching
- Added `csv` for CSV export
- Added `sqlx` with SQLite support for event persistence

### 6. Documentation
**File**: `doc/event-monitoring.md`
- Comprehensive user guide
- Command reference
- Filter DSL documentation
- Integration examples

### 7. Testing
**File**: `examples/test_event_monitor.rs`
- Test script to generate sample events
- Demonstrates various event types and severities

## Architecture

### Event Flow
1. Events published to NATS subjects (e.g., `alchemist.workflow.started`)
2. EventMonitor subscribes to `alchemist.>` pattern
3. Events parsed and enriched with metadata
4. Stored in SQLite database with indexes
5. Statistics updated in real-time
6. Alert rules evaluated
7. Events added to memory buffer for UI

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    severity TEXT NOT NULL,
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlation_id TEXT,
    payload TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

With indexes on:
- timestamp
- domain
- event_type
- severity
- correlation_id

### Filter DSL Grammar
```
expression := term (AND|OR term)*
term := NOT? condition
condition := field:value | field~pattern | field>value | field<value
field := domain | type | severity | correlation | timestamp | metadata.key
```

## Usage Examples

### Command Line
```bash
# List recent events
alchemist event list --domain workflow --severity warning

# Query with DSL
alchemist event query "domain:workflow AND severity:error"

# Export events
alchemist event export csv --output events.csv --filter "severity:error"

# View statistics
alchemist event stats --group-by domain
```

### Programmatic Access
```rust
// Query events
let filter = EventFilter {
    domains: Some(vec!["workflow".to_string()]),
    min_severity: Some(EventSeverity::Warning),
    ..Default::default()
};
let events = monitor.query_events(&filter).await?;

// Get statistics
let stats = monitor.get_statistics().await;
println!("Total events: {}", stats.total_count);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Watching**: Implement the TODO for real-time event watching in the CLI
2. **Complex Alert Actions**: Implement email, webhook, and command execution for alerts
3. **Event Replay**: Add ability to replay events for testing/debugging
4. **Metrics Export**: Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration
5. **Event Correlation**: Automatic correlation chain visualization
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement event batching and compression
7. **Multi-node Support**: Distributed event monitoring across CIM cluster

## Performance Considerations

- Events are processed asynchronously to avoid blocking
- Statistics use exponential moving average for efficiency
- Database writes are optimized with prepared statements
- Memory buffer is capped at configurable size (default 10,000)
- Automatic retention policy removes events older than 30 days

## Integration Points

- **NATS**: Core event transport mechanism
- **Policy Engine**: Events can trigger policy evaluation
- **Workflow Engine**: Workflow events are automatically monitored
- **AI Services**: AI request/response events tracked
- **Deployment System**: Deployment status events monitored

This implementation provides a solid foundation for comprehensive event monitoring in the Alchemist system, with room for future enhancements based on operational needs.
