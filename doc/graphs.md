# Graphs
We represents the universe as a hypergraph.
This is just a special graph that allows an edge to connect more than two nodes, i.e. an edge connecting 3 nodes.

Typically we will be looking at regular Graphs and we need to define those as well. 
These graphs are as such:
Graphs have nodes representing things
Graphs have edges representing a relationship between two nodes
Edges have a direction
Nodes have properties
Nodes may have labels
Edges have properties
Edges may have labels
Nodes have a Radius
Edges have a Weight
Nodes usually represent Nouns
Edges usually represent Action or Behavior
