# Phase 1: Emergency Fixes - Completed

## Overview
This document tracks all the emergency fixes applied to resolve critical timing issues in the Alchemist Graph Editor UI systems.

## Problem
- **Critical Issue**: `EguiContexts::ctx_mut` called for uninitialized context panic
- **Symptoms**: Screen flashing, UI panics, race conditions
- **Root Cause**: UI systems running before egui context initialization

## Solution
All UI systems that use `EguiContexts` must be properly ordered with:
```rust
.after(bevy_egui::EguiPreUpdateSet::InitContexts)
.before(bevy_egui::EguiPreUpdateSet::ProcessInput)
```

## Fixed Systems

### ✅ Fixed UI Systems
1. **graph_editor_ui_system** (src/graph_editor_ui.rs:232)
   - Fixed: Added proper ordering constraints

2. **dashboard_ui_system** (src/dashboard_ui.rs:36)
   - Fixed: Added proper ordering constraints

3. **ui_system** (src/ui.rs:10)
   - Fixed: Added proper ordering constraints

4. **handle_ddd_editor_ui** (src/ddd_editor.rs:273)
   - Fixed: Added proper ordering constraints

5. **graph_inspector_ui** (src/graph_core/plugin.rs:88)
   - Already properly ordered

6. **UI Panel Systems** (src/ui_panels/plugin.rs)
   - Already properly ordered (control_panel_system, inspector_panel_system, menu_bar_system)

7. **theming systems** (src/theming.rs:223)
   - apply_theme_changes already properly ordered

### ⚠️ Systems Still Needing Review
The following systems don't directly use EguiContexts but may need review:
- handle_graph_editor_visibility (src/graph_editor.rs:439)
- handle_workflow_editor_visibility (src/workflow_editor.rs:621)
- Other event handlers that might indirectly trigger UI updates

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run the application and verify no panics occur
- [ ] Check that all UI panels render correctly
- [ ] Verify no screen flashing occurs
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness and interaction
- [ ] Confirm theme switching works properly

## Next Steps
With Phase 1 complete, we can proceed to Phase 2: Component Extraction as outlined in the ECS refactoring plan.
