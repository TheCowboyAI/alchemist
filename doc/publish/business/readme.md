# Alchemist Business Documentation

Business-oriented documentation for stakeholders, executives, and decision makers.

## Executive Overview

### What is Alchemist?

Alchemist is a revolutionary 3D graph visualization and editing system that transforms how organizations understand and interact with complex information. As the primary interface for the **Composable Information Machine (CIM)**, Alchemist creates an immersive environment where data relationships become visible, patterns emerge naturally, and business processes can be designed visually.

### Key Business Benefits

- **Faster Process Completion**: Visual workflows help identify and eliminate bottlenecks
- **Improved Knowledge Discovery**: Semantic search reveals hidden connections
