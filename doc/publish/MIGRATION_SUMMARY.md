# Documentation Migration Summary

## Overview

The `/doc/publish` directory has been completely rewritten to reflect the current CIM architecture based on the actual implementation in the codebase.

## What Was Done

### 1. Archived Old Documentation
- Moved all previous documentation to `/doc/archive/2025-01-publish-legacy/`
- Preserved for historical reference

### 2. Created New Structure
```
doc/publish/
├── README.md                    # Main entry point
├── architecture/               # Core architecture docs
│   ├── README.md              # Architecture overview
│   ├── domain-driven-design.md # DDD implementation
│   └── event-sourcing-cqrs.md # Event sourcing patterns
├── domains/                    # Domain module docs
│   └── README.md              # Domain overview
├── guides/                     # User guides
│   └── getting-started.md     # Quick start guide
├── api/                       # API reference (to be completed)
└── glossary.md                # Terminology reference
```

### 3. Key Documentation Updates

#### Architecture Documentation
- **Architecture Overview**: Complete system architecture with layered design
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Comprehensive DDD patterns and implementation
- **Event Sourcing & CQRS**: Detailed event sourcing and CQRS patterns

#### Domain Documentation
- **Domain Modules Overview**: All 12+ domain modules documented
- Clear separation of Core, Infrastructure, and Visualization domains
- Domain communication patterns and best practices

#### User Guides
- **Getting Started**: Step-by-step installation and first domain creation
- Practical examples with code
- Common issues and troubleshooting

#### Reference Documentation
- **Glossary**: 100+ terms defined across all categories
- Consistent terminology aligned with implementation

## Architecture Reflected

The documentation now accurately reflects:

1. **Modular Domain Structure**
   - Each domain as a separate git submodule
   - Clear bounded contexts
   - Event-driven communication

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Rust with Domain-Driven Design
   - Bevy ECS for visualization
   - NATS for messaging
   - NixOS for development

3. **Core Patterns**
   - Event Sourcing with CID chains
   - CQRS with separate read/write models
   - ECS for presentation layer
   - Conceptual Spaces for semantic representation

## Next Steps

### To Complete

1. **API Reference** (`/api/`)
   - Domain Events catalog
   - Commands & Queries reference
   - Graph Operations API
   - Conceptual Space APIs

2. **Additional Guides** (`/guides/`)
   - Development Setup
   - Testing Strategy
   - Integration Patterns

3. **Architecture Decision Records** (`/architecture/adr/`)
   - Key design decisions
   - Trade-offs and rationale

### Maintenance

- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Update examples as APIs evolve
- Add new domains as they're created
- Maintain glossary with new terms

## Key Improvements

1. **Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual implementation
2. **Completeness**: All current domains and patterns documented
3. **Clarity**: Clear structure and navigation
4. **Practical**: Includes working code examples
5. **Searchable**: Comprehensive glossary and cross-references

The documentation is now a reliable guide to understanding and working with the CIM architecture.
