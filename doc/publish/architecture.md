# Architecture Documentation Has Moved

The architecture documentation has been reorganized and updated to reflect the CIM (Composable Information Machine) integration.

## New Architecture Documentation Location

Please refer to the comprehensive architecture documentation at:

**[üìÅ /doc/publish/architecture/](./architecture/)**

This includes:
- [CIM Integration Overview](./architecture/cim-overview.md) - Complete architectural vision
- [Event Sourcing Patterns](./architecture/event-sourcing.md) - Implementation patterns
- [System Components](./architecture/system-components.md) - Detailed component reference
- [Architecture README](./architecture/README.md) - Navigation guide

## What Changed?

The Information Alchemist has been transformed into a CIM leaf node with:
- Event-driven architecture with immutable events
- Graph-based workflow visualization
- Conceptual spaces for semantic relationships
- AI-native design for agent integration
- Self-referential capabilities

## Legacy Documentation

The previous architecture documentation (pre-CIM) has been archived at:
`/doc/archive/pre-cim-architecture.md`
