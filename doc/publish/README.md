# CIM (Composable Information Machine) Documentation

## Overview

The Composable Information Machine (CIM) is a revolutionary distributed system architecture that transforms how we build, visualize, and reason about information systems. CIM combines:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: All state changes flow through immutable events
- **Graph-Based Workflows**: Visual representation of business processes and knowledge
- **Conceptual Spaces**: Geometric representation of semantic relationships
- **AI-Native Design**: Built for seamless integration with intelligent agents
- **Self-Referential Capability**: Systems that can visualize and reason about themselves

## Key Concepts

### Information as Events
We build a world where information exists as a sequential, append-only series of events:

```
(Command<T> | Query<T>) ‚Üí [Events<T>] ‚Üí Models/Projections
```

### Graph-Based Representation
CIM uses graphs as the primary abstraction for:
- Business workflows
- Knowledge structures
- Event flows
- System architecture

### Conceptual Spaces
Every entity exists in both:
- **Visual Space**: 3D position for rendering
- **Conceptual Space**: Semantic position in knowledge dimensions
