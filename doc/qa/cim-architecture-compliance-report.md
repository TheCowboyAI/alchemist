## Detailed Compliance Analysis

### 1. CIM Architecture Rules Compliance ✅ (85%)

- **Evidence**:
  - NATS JetStream configured and operational
  - Event store with CID chains implemented
  - Event bridge between async/sync domains working
- **Files**: `/src/infrastructure/event_store/`, `/src/infrastructure/event_bridge/`

#### CQRS Pattern ⚠️ (70%)
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Evidence**:

- **Action Required**: Implement comprehensive read models in `/src/application/projections/`

#### Layer Boundaries ✅ (95%)
- **Status**: Excellent separation
- **Evidence**:
  - Clear directory structure: `presentation/`, `application/`, `domain/`, `infrastructure/`
  - No infrastructure leaks into domain
  - Proper async/sync bridge pattern
- **Minor Issue**: Some presentation components could be better isolated

### 2. Domain-Driven Design Compliance ✅ (82%)

#### Ubiquitous Language ✅
- **Status**: Well implemented
- **Evidence**:
  - Consistent naming across events, commands, and value objects
  - No technical suffixes in domain models
  - Business-focused terminology

#### Value Object Immutability ✅
- **Status**: Correctly implemented
- **Evidence**:
  - No "update" events for value objects
  - Proper remove/add pattern for changes
  - Documentation explicitly covers this pattern
- **Reference**: `/doc/design/value-object-immutability.md`

#### Aggregates ⚠️ (60%)
- **Status**: Basic structure, needs completion
- **Evidence**:
  - Graph aggregate started but not complete
  - Missing business rule enforcement
  - Event application patterns need refinement
- **Action Required**: Complete aggregate implementation in `/src/domain/aggregates/`

### 3. Event Sourcing Compliance ✅ (88%)

#### Event Design ✅
- **Status**: Excellent implementation
- **Evidence**:
  - CID chains properly implemented with BLAKE3
  - Events follow past-tense naming convention
  - Self-contained event payloads
  - Proper event versioning structure

#### Event Store ✅
- **Status**: Distributed event store operational
- **Evidence**:
  - NATS JetStream integration complete
  - Stream configuration with retention policies
  - Event publishing with CID integrity
- **Files**: `/src/infrastructure/event_store/distributed.rs`

### 4. Testing Compliance ⚠️ (65%)

#### TDD Practices ⚠️
- **Status**: Tests exist but not test-first
- **Evidence**:
  - 54 unit tests passing
  - Domain tests properly isolated
  - Headless execution configured
- **Gap**: No evidence of test-first development

#### Coverage ❌ (50%)
- **Status**: Below 80% target
- **Evidence**:
  - Good unit test coverage for infrastructure
  - Missing integration tests
  - Domain layer tests incomplete
- **Action Required**: Add comprehensive test suite

### 5. Bevy ECS Compliance ✅ (90%)

#### Component Design ✅
- **Status**: Proper ECS patterns
- **Evidence**:
  - Atomic components (Position3D, GraphNode, etc.)
  - Event-driven systems
  - No ResMut abuse

#### DDD-ECS Isomorphism ✅
- **Status**: Correctly mapped
- **Evidence**:
  - Value objects as components
  - Commands as events
  - Systems as handlers

### 6. NixOS Environment Compliance ✅ (95%)

#### Build System ✅
- **Status**: Properly configured
- **Evidence**:
  - Flake-based configuration
  - Direnv integration
  - All dependencies properly declared
  - Tests made optional for faster builds

### 7. Progress Tracking ✅ (92%)

#### Progress Graph ✅
- **Status**: Well maintained
- **Evidence**:
  - Comprehensive progress.json with 1432 lines
  - Clear milestone tracking
  - Phase completion status accurate
- **Minor Issue**: Some recent updates may not be reflected

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Missing Integration Tests
- **Impact**: Cannot verify end-to-end functionality
- **Required Action**: Create integration test suite in `/tests/integration/`

### 2. Incomplete Domain Model
- **Impact**: Core business logic not fully implemented
- **Required Action**: Complete graph aggregate with full command handling

### 3. Missing Read Model Projections
- **Impact**: Query performance and flexibility limited
- **Required Action**: Implement projection handlers in application layer

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. Complete domain aggregate implementation
2. Add integration test suite
3. Implement read model projections
4. Update progress.json with current status

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. Increase test coverage to 80%
2. Complete Phase 2 domain model
3. Document test-first development process
4. Add performance benchmarks

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)
1. Implement conceptual spaces (Phase 3)
2. Add game theory components (Phase 4)
3. Build AI agent interface (Phase 5)
4. Complete CIM integration (Phase 6)

## Compliance Summary by Rule File

| Rule File | Compliance | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| cim-architecture.mdc | 85% | Strong foundation, read models needed |
| ddd.mdc | 82% | Good naming, aggregates incomplete |
| event-sourcing-cim.mdc | 88% | Excellent implementation |
| bevy_ecs.mdc | 90% | Proper ECS patterns |
| ddd-ecs.mdc | 95% | Correct isomorphism |
| tdd.mdc | 65% | Tests exist but not test-first |
| nixos.mdc | 95% | Well configured |
| conceptual-spaces.mdc | 0% | Not yet implemented |
| graphs.mdc | 70% | Basic visualization, needs domain integration |

## Conclusion

The Information Alchemist project demonstrates strong architectural foundations with proper event sourcing, NATS integration, and layer separation. The main gaps are in test coverage, domain model completion, and the implementation of advanced CIM features like conceptual spaces.

The project is well-positioned to move forward but requires focused effort on completing the domain layer and improving test coverage before proceeding to more advanced phases.
