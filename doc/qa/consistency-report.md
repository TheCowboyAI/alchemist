# Documentation Consistency Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the internal consistency of all documents in `/doc/publish` as of 2025-06-05.

## Identified Inconsistencies

### 1. Duplicate Architecture Documentation

**Issue**: Two different architecture documents exist with conflicting information:
- `/doc/publish/architecture.md` (older, pre-CIM)
- `/doc/publish/architecture/` directory (new, CIM-integrated)

**Conflicts**:
- The older `architecture.md` describes a 4-layer architecture (Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- The new CIM architecture uses 3 layers (Presentation, Domain, Infrastructure) with an Async/Sync Bridge
- The older document doesn't mention CIM, conceptual spaces, or the event-driven architecture's full capabilities
- Event naming in the older document uses correct DDD conventions but lacks CIM context

**Resolution**: The older `architecture.md` should be archived or updated to redirect to the new architecture documentation.

### 2. CIM Documentation Variations

**Issue**: Multiple CIM explanation documents with slightly different perspectives:
- `CIM - The Composable Information Machine.md` (marketing-focused)
- `CIM - Architecture.md` (technical overview)
- `CIM - For the Knowledge worker.md` (business-focused)
- `architecture/cim-overview.md` (comprehensive technical)

**Status**: These are complementary rather than conflicting, targeting different audiences. This is acceptable.

### 3. Technology Stack Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Different documents emphasize different technology choices:
- Some documents mention WebAssembly Runtime and NATS actors
- Others focus on Rust, Bevy ECS, and NATS JetStream
- The relationship between these technologies isn't always clear

**Resolution**: Need to clarify that:
- Current implementation uses Rust + Bevy ECS + NATS JetStream
- WebAssembly Runtime is a future evolution path
- NATS actors are conceptual, implemented as Rust services

### 4. Event Store Implementation Details

**Conflicts**:
- Older `architecture.md`: JSON file persistence
- New architecture documents: NATS JetStream persistence
- Some documents mention CID chains, others don't

**Resolution**: Clarify the evolution path:
- Phase 0-1: JSON file persistence (current)
- Phase 1+: NATS JetStream (planned)
- CID chains are part of future implementation

## Consistent Elements

### 1. DDD Naming Conventions ✅
All documents correctly use:
- Past tense events without "Event" suffix (e.g., `GraphCreated`, not `GraphCreatedEvent`)
- Proper aggregate and entity naming
- Consistent command/query patterns

### 2. Core Architecture Principles ✅
All new documents agree on:
- Event sourcing as foundation
- CQRS pattern implementation
- Graph-based workflow representation
- Conceptual spaces integration

### 3. Layer Responsibilities ✅
The new architecture documents consistently describe:
- Presentation Layer: Bevy ECS
- Domain Layer: Event Sourcing + CQRS
- Infrastructure Layer: NATS + Storage
- Bridge Components: Async/Sync communication

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Archive or Update `architecture.md`**
   - Move to `/doc/archive/` with a note about deprecation
   - OR update to redirect to `/doc/publish/architecture/README.md`

2. **Create Technology Clarification**
   - Add a section in architecture README explaining current vs. future tech
   - Clarify WebAssembly Runtime as future evolution

3. **Consolidate Event Store Documentation**
   - Clearly state current implementation (JSON)
   - Document migration path to JetStream
   - Explain when CID chains will be implemented

### Future Improvements

1. **Version Tagging**
   - Add version numbers to architecture documents
   - Tag which features are implemented vs. planned

2. **Cross-Reference Index**
   - Create an index showing which document to read for which purpose
   - Add "See Also" sections linking related documents

3. **Implementation Status**
   - Add status badges (Implemented/Planned/Experimental)
   - Link to progress.json for current status

## Conclusion

The documentation in `/doc/publish` is largely consistent, with the main issue being the presence of pre-CIM architecture documentation alongside the new CIM-integrated documentation. The various CIM explanation documents serve different audiences effectively. With the recommended updates, the documentation will provide a clear, consistent view of the Information Alchemist architecture.

### Overall Consistency Score: 7/10

**Strengths**:
- Consistent DDD naming conventions
- Clear architectural vision
- Good audience segmentation

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Remove/update outdated documentation
- Clarify current vs. future technology choices
- Add clearer implementation status indicators

## Updates Applied (2025-06-05)

### 1. Removed Generic "Service" Naming
- **Issue**: `ConceptualSpaceService` violated DDD naming principles
- **Fix**: Replaced with specific domain components:
  - `ConceptualMapping` - Handles text-to-conceptual-point mapping
  - `ConceptualSimilarity` - Calculates similarity between points
  - `ConceptualTopology` - Manages spatial relationships and clustering
- **Result**: More intention-revealing names that follow DDD principles

### 2. Archived Pre-CIM Architecture
- **Action**: Moved `architecture.md` to `/doc/archive/pre-cim-architecture.md`
- **Created**: Redirect document pointing to new architecture location
- **Result**: Eliminated confusion between old and new architecture

### Updated Consistency Score: 8/10

The documentation is now more consistent with proper DDD naming conventions and clearer separation between current and legacy documentation.
