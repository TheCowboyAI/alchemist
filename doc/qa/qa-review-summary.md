# QA Review Summary - Domain Consistency

**Date:** January 24, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/qa-domain-consistency`

## Work Completed

### 1. QA Review Infrastructure
- ✅ Created comprehensive QA review script (`scripts/qa-domain-review.sh`)
- ✅ Generated domain consistency report (`doc/qa/domain-consistency-report.md`)
- ✅ Created documentation templates for standardization

### 2. Documentation Distribution
- ✅ Copied existing user stories from `doc/testing/` to individual domains
- ✅ Created script to automate user story distribution (`scripts/copy-user-stories.sh`)
- ✅ Added README files for domains missing them (conceptualspaces, dialog)

### 3. Key Findings

#### Domain Completeness Status
- **2/14 domains fully consistent** (Git and Nix - 14% complete)
- **All domains missing API documentation**
- **50% missing examples**
- **36% missing doc/ directory**
- **29% missing README.md**

#### Structural Issues Identified
1. **cim-domain-bevy**: Non-standard structure (missing all DDD components)
2. **cim-domain-identity**: Missing value_objects directory (refactored to ECS)
3. **cim-domain-location**: Missing queries and projections
4. **cim-domain-graph**: Missing tests directory

### 4. Documentation Added

#### User Stories Distributed To:
- cim-domain-agent
- cim-domain-conceptualspaces
- cim-domain-document
- cim-domain-location
- cim-domain-organization
- cim-domain-person
- cim-domain-policy
- cim-domain-workflow

#### New README Files Created:
- cim-domain-conceptualspaces/README.md
- cim-domain-dialog/README.md

### 5. Templates Created
- **doc/templates/domain-user-stories.md** - Standard format for user stories
- **doc/templates/domain-api.md** - Standard format for API documentation

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: API Documentation (1-2 days)
Generate API documentation for all domains using the template

### Priority 2: Missing Examples (2-3 days)
Create at least one working example for each domain lacking them

### Priority 3: Structural Fixes (3-4 days)
1. Fix cim-domain-bevy structure or document why it's different
2. Add missing directories (value_objects, queries, projections, tests)
3. Ensure all domains follow DDD patterns

### Priority 4: README Files
Create README.md for:
- cim-domain-document
- cim-domain-policy

## Submodule Considerations

The following domains are git submodules with untracked content:
- cim-domain-agent (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-conceptualspaces (added doc/user-stories.md, README.md)
- cim-domain-dialog (added doc/user-stories.md, README.md)
- cim-domain-document (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-location (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-organization (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-person (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-policy (added doc/user-stories.md)
- cim-domain-workflow (added doc/user-stories.md)

These changes exist in the submodules but haven't been committed to their respective repositories.

## Success Metrics

Progress towards 100% domain consistency:
- [ ] All domains have complete documentation (0/14 complete)
- [ ] All domains have at least one example (7/14 complete)
- [ ] All domains follow standard DDD structure (12/14 complete)
- [ ] All tests pass across all domains
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions applied

## Conclusion

This QA review has identified significant gaps in documentation and examples across the CIM domains. While the core functionality appears complete (based on test counts), the lack of documentation significantly impacts usability. The templates and scripts created in this review provide the foundation for a systematic improvement effort.
