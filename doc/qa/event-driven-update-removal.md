# Event-Driven Architecture: Removal of Update Operations

## Summary

We have successfully removed all "update" operations from the conceptual space implementation to align with proper event-driven architecture principles. In event-driven systems, there is no concept of "updating" - only adding, removing, and deleting. Any modification is implemented as a complete replacement of the component.

## Changes Made

### 1. ConceptualChange Enum Refactoring

**Before:**
```rust
pub enum ConceptualChange {
    CreateConcept { ... },
    UpdateQualities { concept_id, updates },
    MoveInSpace { concept_id, new_position },
    MergeConcepts { source_id, target_id, merged_position },
    SplitConcept { original_id, new_concepts },
    RemoveConcept { concept_id },
}
```

**After:**
```rust
pub enum ConceptualChange {
    AddConcept { concept_id, concept_type, position, qualities },
    RemoveConcept { concept_id },
    AddToRegion { concept_id, region_id },
    RemoveFromRegion { concept_id, region_id },
}
```

### 2. Event Projection Pattern

All event projections now follow the remove-then-add pattern:

```rust
fn project(&self) -> Vec<ConceptualChange> {
    match self {
        PrivateMortgageEvent::PropertyInspected { loan_id, value_change, .. } => {
            // Property value changes require removing old concept and adding new one
            let concept_id = ConceptId::from_uuid(*loan_id);
            let new_position = self.calculate_new_position_after_inspection(*value_change);

            vec![
                ConceptualChange::RemoveConcept { concept_id },
                ConceptualChange::AddConcept {
                    concept_id,
                    concept_type: "PrivateMortgage".to_string(),
                    position: new_position,
                    qualities: self.concept_qualities(),
                }
            ]
        }
        // ... other events follow same pattern
    }
}
```

### 3. Domain Specialization

We also specialized the example from generic "Loan" concepts to specific "Private Mortgage Lending" domain:

- **16 specialized dimensions** for private mortgage lending
- **Loan types**: Hard Money, Bridge, Construction, Fix & Flip
- **Events**: Property inspections, draw requests, exit strategy updates
- **Business-specific quality dimensions**: LTV ratio, funding speed, exit strategy clarity

## Principles Enforced

1. **No Updates**: There are no update operations anywhere in the system
2. **Immutability**: Components are immutable - changes require full replacement
3. **Event Semantics**: Events represent complete state transitions, not partial mutations
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Remove and Add are distinct business events with clear semantics

## Files Modified

1. `cim-conceptual-core/src/projection.rs` - Removed all update-related variants from ConceptualChange
2. `cim-conceptual-core/examples/loan_concept_example.rs` - Updated to use remove+add pattern and specialized for private mortgage lending
3. `doc/design/conceptual-spaces-business-domains.md` - Updated documentation to reflect private mortgage specialization
4. `doc/plan/bounded-context-conceptual-spaces-alignment.md` - Fixed example to use proper event-driven patterns

## Testing

All tests pass successfully with the new implementation:
- 5 conceptual space tests passing
- Example compiles and runs correctly
- No update operations remain in the codebase

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Aligns with event-driven architecture principles
2. **Auditability**: Clear event trail showing complete replacements
3. **Simplicity**: No complex merge or update logic
4. **Integrity**: Events represent complete facts, not partial changes
