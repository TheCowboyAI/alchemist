## Functionality Implementation Priority

### Priority 1: Core Domain Completion (MUST HAVE)
1. **Workflow Aggregate Implementation**
   - Complete aggregate structure
   - Implement all command handlers
   - Add event handlers
   - Business rule validation

2. **Command Handler Completion**
   - Add proper aggregate loading
   - Implement transaction boundaries
   - Add idempotency checks

3. **Basic Projections**
   - GraphSummaryProjection
   - NodeListProjection
   - WorkflowStatusProjection

### Priority 2: Essential Infrastructure (MUST HAVE)
1. **NATS Plugin Implementation**
   - Message routing
   - Subscription management
   - Error handling

2. **Graph Composition Operations**
   - Union, intersection, product
   - Composition validation

3. **Integration Test Suite**
   - End-to-end tests
   - Projection tests
   - Event replay tests

### Priority 3: Identity Context (SHOULD HAVE)
1. **Person Aggregate**
   - Commands and events
   - Repository implementation

2. **Organization Aggregate**
   - Commands and events
   - Repository implementation

3. **Identity Projections**
   - Person directory
   - Organization hierarchy

### Priority 4: Advanced Features (NICE TO HAVE)
1. **External System Projections**
2. **Advanced Graph Invariants**
3. **Performance Optimizations**

## Required Actions Before Phase Progression

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. ✅ Complete WorkflowAggregate implementation
2. ✅ Fix all command handlers to load aggregates properly
3. ✅ Implement at least 3 basic projections
4. ✅ Create comprehensive integration test suite
5. ✅ Fix NATS plugin message routing

### Short-term Actions (Week 2)
1. ✅ Complete graph composition operations
2. ✅ Implement identity context basics
3. ✅ Add graph invariant checking
4. ✅ Achieve 80% test coverage

### Validation Criteria
Before moving to the next phase, ALL of the following must be true:
- [ ] All Priority 1 items completed and tested
- [ ] All Priority 2 items completed and tested
- [ ] Integration tests passing with >90% reliability
- [ ] Domain test coverage >80%
- [ ] No TODO/unimplemented in core modules
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Documentation updated for all new functionality

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Workflow Aggregate** - Core to system functionality
2. **Command Handlers** - Data integrity depends on proper implementation
3. **Integration Tests** - Cannot verify system works without these

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Graph Composition** - Important for advanced features
2. **Identity Context** - Needed for real-world usage
3. **Projections** - Query performance depends on these

### Low Risk Items
1. **External Projections** - Can be added incrementally
2. **Advanced Invariants** - Nice to have but not critical
3. **Performance Optimizations** - Can be done later

## Conclusion

The system has a solid architectural foundation but lacks critical implementation in several core areas. The most pressing need is to complete the Workflow aggregate, fix command handlers, and create a comprehensive test suite. Without these, the system cannot be considered functional or ready for the next phase.

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-3 weeks of focused development
**Current Completion**: ~40% of required functionality
**Blocking Next Phase**: YES - Phase 3 cannot begin until these gaps are addressed
