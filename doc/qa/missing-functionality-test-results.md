# Missing Functionality Test Results

## Summary

We have added 50+ new tests that expose the gap between claimed and actual functionality. These tests use `#[should_panic]` to document what SHOULD exist but doesn't.

## Test Categories Added

### 1. Feature Tests (`src/testing/feature_tests.rs`)
Tests for each major claimed feature:
- ✅ 3D/2D Visualization (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Subgraph Composition (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Real-time Collaboration (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ AI Integration (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ WASM Plugin System (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Event-Driven Architecture (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Performance Claims (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Editing Capabilities (5 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ File I/O (3 tests) - ALL FAIL

**Total: 29 feature tests documenting missing functionality**

### 2. Integration Tests (`src/testing/integration_tests.rs`)
End-to-end workflow tests:
- ✅ Complete graph editing workflow - FAILS (no interactive editing)
- ✅ Import/Edit/Export cycle - FAILS (hardcoded import)
- ✅ JSON round-trip - FAILS (import limitations)
- ✅ Create new empty graph - FAILS (only hardcoded data)
- ✅ Multi-graph support - FAILS (single graph only)
- ✅ Performance at scale - FAILS (no optimizations)
- ✅ UI interactions - FAILS (no interactive features)
- ✅ Collaboration - FAILS (no networking)

**Total: 15+ integration tests exposing workflow gaps**

### 3. Performance Tests (`src/testing/performance_tests.rs`)
Performance and optimization tests:
- ✅ 10k nodes performance - FAILS
- ✅ 100k nodes performance - FAILS
- ✅ 250k nodes at 60 FPS - FAILS (the main claim)
- ✅ FPS monitoring - FAILS
- ✅ Memory profiling - FAILS
- ✅ Rendering optimizations (5 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Scalability features (3 tests) - ALL FAIL
- ✅ Stress testing (3 tests) - ALL FAIL

**Total: 16 performance tests proving optimization claims are false**

## Key Findings

### What Actually Works
1. Basic graph rendering with hardcoded test data
2. Camera controls (rotate, zoom)
3. Force-directed layout (press L)
4. Node visualization styles (Ctrl+1-4)
5. Basic selection system
6. Export to JSON with file dialog (Ctrl+S)

### What's Completely Missing
1. **No 2D mode or switching** - Only 3D exists
2. **No graph composition** - Can't load/combine multiple graphs
3. **No collaboration** - Zero networking code
4. **No AI integration** - Not even stubs
5. **No plugin system** - No WASM support
6. **No performance optimization** - Would crash with large graphs
7. **No interactive editing** - Can't add/remove nodes/edges
8. **No event sourcing** - Basic events but no audit trail
9. **No file dialog for import** - Hardcoded to one file
10. **No new graph creation** - Always loads test data

## Test Execution

To run these tests and see the failures:

```bash
# Run all missing feature tests
BEVY_HEADLESS=1 cargo test --lib feature_tests

# Run integration tests
BEVY_HEADLESS=1 cargo test --lib integration_tests

# Run performance tests
BEVY_HEADLESS=1 cargo test --lib performance_tests
```

Or use the provided Nix script:
```bash
nix-shell -p cargo --run "bash run-missing-feature-tests.nix"
```

## Conclusion

The test suite now accurately reflects the state of the project:
- **60+ new tests** document missing functionality
- All tests use `#[should_panic]` to show they're expected to fail
- Each test includes comments explaining what SHOULD work
- The gap between claims and reality is now fully documented

This provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be implemented to match the README's claims.
