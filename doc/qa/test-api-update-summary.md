# Test API Update Summary

## Overview
All test files have been successfully updated to use the current APIs across the entire codebase. All library tests are now passing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Test File Imports
- Changed imports from old `ia::` module structure to new module structure:
  - `cim-contextgraph` for graph functionality
  - `cim-domain` for domain models
  - `cim-ipld` for IPLD/CID functionality
  - `cim-compose` for composition features
  - `cim-viz-bevy` for visualization
  - `cim-subject` for subject handling

### 2. Fixed Test File Location
- Moved `tests/contexts/graph/context_graph_tests.rs` to `cim-contextgraph/tests/context_graph_integration_tests.rs`
- This ensures tests are properly associated with their respective submodules

### 3. Updated Test APIs
- Removed references to old command/event patterns in graph tests
- Updated to use direct graph manipulation API:
  - `add_node()` instead of command-based node creation
  - `add_edge()` instead of command-based edge creation
  - Direct property access instead of event-based updates

### 4. Fixed Compilation Issues
- Added missing `NodeHovered` and `NodeUnhovered` events to `cim-viz-bevy/src/events.rs`
- Fixed unused imports and warnings across multiple modules
- Removed deprecated `.with_description()` method calls in examples

### 5. Test Results Summary

All library tests are now passing:

| Module | Tests Passed | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| cim-compose | 14 | ✅ |
| cim-contextgraph | 42 | ✅ |
| cim-domain | 216 | ✅ |
| cim-ipld | 8 | ✅ |
| cim-subject | 32 | ✅ |
| cim-viz-bevy | 9 | ✅ |
| **Total** | **321** | **✅** |

## Archived Tests
Tests in `doc/archive/2024-12-tests/` are archived and were not updated as they represent historical test implementations.

## Next Steps
1. Fix compilation errors in examples (many examples have outdated API usage)
2. Add integration tests that verify cross-module interactions
3. Consider adding more comprehensive test coverage for new functionality

## Conclusion
The test infrastructure is now properly aligned with the current module structure and all library tests are passing. The codebase has a solid foundation of working tests that can be built upon.
