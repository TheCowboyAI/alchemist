# Handler Coverage Tests Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive handler existence tests to ensure every command and event in the system has a corresponding handler, following TDD principles that all commands and events MUST be able to be handled.

## Tests Added

### Command Handler Tests (6 tests)
Located in: `/src/domain/commands/mod.rs`

1. **test_all_graph_commands_have_handlers**
   - Tests all GraphCommand variants (CreateGraph, DeleteGraph, UpdateGraph, etc.)
   - Ensures each command type can be processed

2. **test_all_node_commands_have_handlers**
   - Tests all NodeCommand variants (AddNode, RemoveNode, UpdateNode, MoveNode, SelectNode, DeselectNode)
   - Verifies complete node command coverage

3. **test_all_edge_commands_have_handlers**
   - Tests all EdgeCommand variants (ConnectEdge, DisconnectEdge, SelectEdge, DeselectEdge)
   - Ensures edge operations are fully covered

4. **test_workflow_commands_have_handlers**
   - Tests all WorkflowCommand variants (CreateWorkflow, AddStep, ConnectSteps, ValidateWorkflow, StartWorkflow, CompleteStep, PauseWorkflow, ResumeWorkflow, FailWorkflow)
   - Comprehensive workflow command coverage

5. **test_command_wrapper_handling**
   - Tests the Command enum wrapper properly handles all command types
   - Verifies pattern matching works for Graph, Node, Edge, and Workflow commands

6. **test_invalid_command_handling**
   - Tests that invalid commands are properly rejected
   - Ensures command validation is working

### Event Handler Tests (6 tests)
Located in: `/src/domain/events/mod.rs`

1. **test_all_graph_events_have_handlers**
   - Tests all GraphEvent variants (GraphCreated, GraphDeleted, GraphRenamed, GraphTagged, GraphUntagged, GraphUpdated, GraphImportRequested, GraphImportCompleted, GraphImportFailed)
   - Ensures complete graph event coverage

2. **test_all_node_events_have_handlers**
   - Tests all NodeEvent variants (NodeAdded, NodeRemoved, NodeUpdated, NodeMoved, NodeContentChanged)
   - Verifies node event processing

3. **test_all_edge_events_have_handlers**
   - Tests all EdgeEvent variants (EdgeConnected, EdgeRemoved, EdgeUpdated, EdgeReversed)
   - Note: Fixed to use actual EdgeEvent structure from edge.rs (not edge_events.rs)

4. **test_all_workflow_events_have_handlers**
   - Tests all WorkflowEvent variants (WorkflowCreated, StepAdded, StepsConnected, WorkflowValidated, WorkflowStarted, StepCompleted, WorkflowPaused, WorkflowResumed, WorkflowCompleted, WorkflowFailed)
   - Comprehensive workflow event coverage

5. **test_domain_event_wrapper_handling**
   - Tests the DomainEvent enum wrapper properly handles all event types
   - Verifies pattern matching for Graph, Node, Edge, and Workflow events

6. **test_event_processing_failures**
   - Tests graceful handling of event processing failures
   - Example: orphaned events with invalid references

## Issues Fixed During Implementation

1. **NodeContent Import**
   - Fixed import path from `content_types` to `value_objects`

2. **EdgeRelationship Structure**
   - Fixed usage to match actual struct with fields (relationship_type, properties, bidirectional)
   - Not an enum as initially assumed

3. **WorkflowStep Structure**
   - Updated to match actual implementation with fields: id, name, step_type, node_id, inputs, outputs, timeout_ms, retry_policy
   - Fixed StepType to use UserTask instead of Task

4. **EdgeEvent Structure**
   - Used correct EdgeEvent from edge.rs (not edge_events.rs)
   - Fixed EdgeDisconnected â†’ EdgeRemoved
   - Fixed relationship field to be String instead of EdgeRelationship

5. **WorkflowResult Structure**
   - Fixed to use as struct with outputs and metrics fields
   - Not an enum with Success variant

## Test Results
- All 12 handler tests passing
- Total tests increased from 74 to 94 (20 new tests added)
- Passing tests increased from 66 to 81 (15 more passing)
- Still 13 tests failing (all for unimplemented features)

## Next Steps
Per TDD requirements, we need to:
1. Implement the missing handlers for failing tests
2. Add integration tests for handler execution
3. Add performance tests for handler processing
4. Increase overall test coverage to 95% (current target in rules)
