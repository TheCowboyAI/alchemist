2. NATS event flow tests
3. Projection synchronization tests
4. Error recovery scenarios

### Priority 3: Performance Tests (Week 3)

3. Query performance tests
4. Memory usage profiling

### Priority 4: External Integration (Week 4)
1. External system projection tests
2. Bidirectional sync tests
3. Error handling tests
4. Performance impact tests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix failing tests** - 8 tests need immediate attention
2. **Implement import pipeline** - Critical missing functionality
3. **Add integration tests** - Currently no end-to-end coverage
4. **Create performance benchmarks** - No performance validation

### Process Improvements
1. **Enforce TDD** - Write tests before implementation
2. **Coverage gates** - Fail builds below 80% coverage
3. **Integration test suite** - Run on every commit
4. **Performance regression tests** - Track performance over time

### Technical Debt
1. **Import handler implementation** - Currently returns None
2. **Event processing gaps** - Many events not handled
3. **Query infrastructure** - No query handlers implemented
4. **External projections** - Only stubs exist

## Conclusion

The project has significant gaps between implemented functionality and test coverage. Critical features like import processing, query handling, and external integrations lack both implementation and tests. The immediate priority should be implementing the import pipeline with comprehensive tests, followed by integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality.

**Risk Level**: High - Critical business functionality is untested and partially unimplemented.

**Recommended Action**: Halt new feature development and focus on implementing missing functionality with proper test coverage.
