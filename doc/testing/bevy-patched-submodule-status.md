# Bevy-Patched Submodule Status

## Current Configuration

The `bevy-patched` submodule is properly configured and functioning correctly.

### Submodule Details

- **Path**: `bevy-patched`
- **Remote URL**: `https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/bevy.git`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Current Commit**: `db72716bb4f335936487e529dde8a785b10837d9`
- **Status**: Clean, up-to-date

### Recent Patches Applied

The bevy-patched repository contains custom fixes for Bevy v0.16.1:

1. **Component Derive Fix** (latest commit)
   - Fixed Component derive for experimental features
   
2. **Manual Component Implementation**
   - ViewDepthTexture: Added manual Component implementation to fix linking
   - OcclusionCullingSubview: Added manual Component implementation
   - Fixes undefined symbol errors when using dynamic linking

### Purpose

This patched version of Bevy addresses specific issues with:
- Dynamic linking in NixOS environments
- Component trait implementations for experimental features
- Undefined symbol errors that occur with the standard Bevy release

### Integration with CIM

The bevy-patched submodule is essential for:
- Proper Bevy ECS functionality in our NixOS development environment
- Dynamic linking support required for fast development builds
- Compatibility with our event-driven architecture

### Verification

To verify the submodule is working correctly:

```bash
# Check submodule status
git submodule status bevy-patched

# Update if needed
git submodule update --init --recursive bevy-patched

# Verify it's on the correct commit
cd bevy-patched && git rev-parse HEAD
# Should output: db72716bb4f335936487e529dde8a785b10837d9
```

### No Action Required

The bevy-patched submodule is already properly configured as a Git submodule and does not require any fixes or updates at this time.

## Event-Driven Testing Integration

While bevy-patched itself doesn't need event-driven tests (it's an external dependency), the modules that use it do:

- **cim-domain-bevy**: Needs tests for UI→NATS event publishing
- **Main application**: Needs tests for Bevy ECS→Domain event mapping

These are already included in the event-driven testing implementation plan.
