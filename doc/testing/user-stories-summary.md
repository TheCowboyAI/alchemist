## Common Patterns Across Domains

### Event-Driven Architecture
- All domains generate domain events
- Events follow past-tense naming (Created, Updated, Deleted)
- CID chains ensure event integrity
- NATS subjects organize event streams

### CQRS Implementation
- Commands express intent (Create, Update, Delete)
- Queries separate from commands
- Projections for read models
- Event sourcing for audit trails

### Security and Privacy
- Role-based access control
- Fine-grained permissions
- Privacy settings per domain
- Audit trails for compliance

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for domain logic
- Integration tests for event flows
- Performance tests for scale
- Security tests for access control

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
1. Core graph operations ✅
2. Event sourcing infrastructure ✅
3. Basic visualization ✅

### Phase 2: Domain Implementation
1. Agent domain - Core lifecycle and capabilities
2. Identity domain - Authentication and authorization
3. Document domain - Basic CRUD and versioning
4. Workflow domain - Simple workflow execution

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
1. Conceptual spaces integration
2. AI agent capabilities
3. Semantic search and similarity
4. Automated classification

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Complex workflow patterns
2. Multi-agent collaboration
3. Advanced document intelligence
4. Federation and SSO

## Metrics and Success Criteria

### Coverage Goals
- 95% test coverage per domain
- All commands have handlers
- All events have handlers
- All queries implemented

### Performance Targets

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Core Stories**: Focus on lifecycle and CRUD operations
2. **Build Test Suite**: Create tests for each user story
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify cross-domain interactions
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure scalability targets
5. **Documentation**: Keep user stories updated with implementation
