### Critical Issues Found

1. **üö® UI Events Not Publishing to NATS**
   - Location: cim-domain-bevy
   - Impact: No events from UI reach JetStream
   - Status: Identified, fix pending

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Correlation/Causation IDs**
   - Location: All existing events in JetStream
   - Impact: Cannot trace event chains
   - Status: Framework created to fix

### Test Metrics

| Metric                      | Current | Target |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Submodules with event tests | 0/31    | 31/31  |
| Event types tested          | 0       | 150+   |
| Cross-domain flows tested   | 0       | 20+    |
| End-to-end scenarios        | 0       | 10+    |

### Next Actions

1. **TODAY**: Start implementing tests in `cim-infrastructure`
2. **TOMORROW**: Complete infrastructure layer testing
3. **THIS WEEK**: Get through domain fundamentals
4. **PRIORITY**: Fix UI‚ÜíNATS event publishing in parallel

### Testing Command Reference

```bash
# Run infrastructure tests
cd cim-infrastructure && cargo test event_flow

# Run all event tests across workspace
cargo test --workspace event_flow

# Check event publishing to NATS
./examples/show_jetstream_events

# Validate specific domain
cd cim-domain-graph && cargo test --test event_flow_tests
```

### Daily Checklist

- [ ] Update this dashboard with progress
- [ ] Run existing tests to ensure no regression
- [ ] Document any new issues found
- [ ] Update progress.json with milestones
