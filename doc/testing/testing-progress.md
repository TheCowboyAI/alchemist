### Total Tests Written: 142
### Total Tests Passing: 142 (100% pass rate)

## Key Achievements

### cim-ipld
- Discovered sophisticated content routing and domain partitioning
- Comprehensive codec system for custom content types
- Object store with pull options and content deduplication
- Content service with lifecycle hooks and transformations

### cim-keys
- Complete key lifecycle management (generation, storage, retrieval)
- SSH key support with OpenSSH format compatibility
- TLS/X.509 certificate generation and validation
- Three-level PKI hierarchy (Operator, Domain, User)
- YubiKey PIV slot allocation patterns
- Secure storage with encryption at rest

### cim-subject
- Algebraic operations on NATS subjects (sequential, parallel, choice composition)
- Subject lattice structure with join/meet operations
- Pattern matching with NATS-style wildcards (* and >)
- Bidirectional subject translation between schemas
- Context injection and transformations
- Custom composition rules and projections

## Next Steps

1. **cim-bridge** (Tier 0) - Bridge between domains
2. **cim-component** (Tier 0) - Component system
3. **cim-contextgraph** (Tier 0) - Context graph implementation
4. **cim-domain** (Tier 1) - Core domain functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Discovery**: Tests reveal actual API structure vs expected
2. **Mock Patterns**: Use mock implementations for hardware dependencies (YubiKey)
3. **Test Organization**: Group tests by functionality, not just by module
4. **Documentation**: Mermaid diagrams in test docs help visualize test flows
5. **Incremental Testing**: Start with basic functionality, then add comprehensive tests

## Testing Patterns Established

### Event Flow Tests
- Basic type creation and validation
- Serialization/deserialization
- Type conversions and mappings

### Comprehensive Tests
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance and scalability
- Integration scenarios
- Security validations

### Mock Testing
- Hardware abstraction (YubiKey, HSM)
- External service simulation
- Async operation testing

## Metrics

- **Average Tests per Module**: 47.3
- **Test Categories**: Event Flow, Unit, Integration, Comprehensive
- **Coverage Areas**: Core functionality, Error handling, Security, Performance
