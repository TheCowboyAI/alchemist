# Event Store Integration Completion Plan

## Current Status (70% Complete)

We have successfully:
- ✅ Created infrastructure module in cim-domain
- ✅ Implemented NatsClient with connection management and JetStream context
- ✅ Created EventStore trait for event persistence abstraction
- ✅ Integrated cim-ipld for CID chain functionality
- ✅ Created EventWrapper to make DomainEventEnum compatible with TypedContent
- ✅ Implemented JetStreamEventStore with CID chain verification
- ✅ Added event caching with LRU cache for performance
- ✅ Implemented optimistic concurrency control with version checking
- ✅ Created unit tests for event store functionality
- ✅ Created integration tests with real NATS server
- ✅ Implemented EventReplayService with handlers
- ✅ Created three comprehensive demo applications
- ✅ Fixed all demo compilation errors

## Remaining Tasks (30%)

### 1. Snapshot Store Implementation
- [ ] Complete the snapshot store implementation
- [ ] Add snapshot serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Implement snapshot policies (frequency, size thresholds)
- [ ] Add tests for snapshot functionality

### 2. Event Store Monitoring
- [ ] Add metrics collection for event store operations
- [ ] Implement health checks for NATS connection
- [ ] Add event store statistics (event count, throughput, latency)
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard example

### 3. Production Readiness
- [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery strategies
- [ ] Implement event store backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Add event archival for old events
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

### 4. Integration with Main Application
- [ ] Connect event store to command handlers
- [ ] Wire up event replay for aggregate loading
- [ ] Implement projection rebuilding from events
- [ ] Add event store to main application startup

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Benchmark event store performance
- [ ] Optimize CID chain verification for large event streams
- [ ] Implement event batching for high-throughput scenarios
- [ ] Add connection pooling for NATS clients

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Snapshot Store** (2 hours)
   - Implement snapshot serialization
   - Add snapshot policies
   - Create tests

2. **Add Monitoring** (2 hours)
   - Implement basic metrics
   - Add health checks
   - Create example dashboard

3. **Integration Tests** (1 hour)
   - Test with main application
   - Verify end-to-end flow
   - Document integration patterns

## Success Criteria

- All event store tests passing
- Demos running successfully with persistent event storage
- Event replay working for aggregate reconstruction
- Monitoring showing healthy metrics
- Documentation complete for production deployment
