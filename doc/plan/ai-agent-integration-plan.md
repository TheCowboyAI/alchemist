# AI Agent Integration Plan for CIM

## Overview

With the Graph Abstraction Layer complete, we can now integrate AI agents that leverage the unified graph interface to perform intelligent operations across all graph types. This plan outlines the approach for creating AI-powered capabilities that enhance the CIM system.

## Goals

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Enable AI agents to understand and reason about graph structures
2. **Intelligent Transformations**: AI-suggested graph transformations based on patterns
3. **Automated Workflows**: AI-driven workflow optimization and execution
4. **Knowledge Discovery**: Pattern recognition and insight generation from graphs

## Architecture

### 1. Agent Interface Layer

```rust
// Core trait for AI agents working with graphs
pub trait GraphAgent: Send + Sync {
    /// Analyze a graph and provide insights
    async fn analyze_graph(
        &self,
        graph: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<GraphAnalysis, AgentError>;
    
    /// Suggest transformations to improve the graph
    async fn suggest_transformations(
        &self,
        graph: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<Vec<TransformationSuggestion>, AgentError>;
    
    /// Execute automated actions on the graph
    async fn execute_actions(
        &self,
        graph: &mut dyn GraphImplementation,
        actions: Vec<AgentAction>,
    ) -> Result<ActionResults, AgentError>;
}

pub struct GraphAnalysis {
    pub insights: Vec<Insight>,
    pub patterns: Vec<Pattern>,
    pub anomalies: Vec<Anomaly>,
    pub recommendations: Vec<Recommendation>,
}
```

### 2. Specialized Agents

#### Workflow Optimization Agent
```rust
pub struct WorkflowOptimizationAgent {
    pub llm_client: LLMClient,
    pub pattern_library: PatternLibrary,
}

impl WorkflowOptimizationAgent {
    /// Analyze workflow for bottlenecks and inefficiencies
    pub async fn find_bottlenecks(
        &self,
        workflow: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<Vec<Bottleneck>, AgentError>;
    
    /// Suggest parallel execution opportunities
    pub async fn suggest_parallelization(
        &self,
        workflow: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<Vec<ParallelizationOpportunity>, AgentError>;
}
```

#### Knowledge Graph Agent
```rust
pub struct KnowledgeGraphAgent {
    pub embedding_model: EmbeddingModel,
    pub reasoning_engine: ReasoningEngine,
}

impl KnowledgeGraphAgent {
    /// Find semantic relationships between concepts
    pub async fn discover_relationships(
        &self,
        graph: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<Vec<SemanticRelationship>, AgentError>;
    
    /// Generate new concepts from existing ones
    pub async fn synthesize_concepts(
        &self,
        graph: &dyn GraphImplementation,
        context: &ConceptualContext,
    ) -> Result<Vec<NewConcept>, AgentError>;
}
```

#### Graph Transformation Agent
```rust
pub struct TransformationAgent {
    pub transformer: Arc<dyn GraphTransformer>,
    pub quality_evaluator: QualityEvaluator,
}

impl TransformationAgent {
    /// Suggest optimal target type for transformation
    pub async fn suggest_target_type(
        &self,
        source: &dyn GraphImplementation,
        purpose: &str,
    ) -> Result<String, AgentError>;
    
    /// Evaluate transformation quality
    pub async fn evaluate_transformation(
        &self,
        source: &dyn GraphImplementation,
        target: &dyn GraphImplementation,
    ) -> Result<TransformationQuality, AgentError>;
}
```

### 3. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Event-Driven Agent Actions
```rust
#[derive(Event, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct AgentActionRequested {
    pub agent_id: AgentId,
    pub graph_id: GraphId,
    pub action_type: AgentActionType,
    pub parameters: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

#[derive(Event, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct AgentActionCompleted {
    pub agent_id: AgentId,
    pub graph_id: GraphId,
    pub results: ActionResults,
    pub duration: Duration,
}
```

#### Agent Command Handler
```rust
pub struct AgentCommandHandler {
    agents: HashMap<AgentId, Arc<dyn GraphAgent>>,
    abstraction_layer: Arc<GraphAbstractionLayer>,
}

impl AgentCommandHandler {
    pub async fn handle_command(
        &self,
        command: AgentCommand,
    ) -> Result<Vec<DomainEvent>, AgentError> {
        match command {
            AgentCommand::AnalyzeGraph { agent_id, graph_id } => {
                let agent = self.get_agent(agent_id)?;
                let graph = self.abstraction_layer.get_graph(graph_id).await?;
                let analysis = agent.analyze_graph(&*graph).await?;
                
                Ok(vec![DomainEvent::AgentAnalysisCompleted {
                    agent_id,
                    graph_id,
                    analysis,
                }])
            }
            // Other commands...
        }
    }
}
```

   - Accurate pattern recognition (90%+ precision)

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive agent interaction in UI
   - Clear explanation of agent reasoning
   - Easy integration with existing workflows

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Workflow Optimization
```rust
// User has a complex order processing workflow
let workflow = abstraction.get_graph(workflow_id, "workflow").await?;
let agent = WorkflowOptimizationAgent::new();

let analysis = agent.analyze_graph(&workflow).await?;
println!("Found {} bottlenecks", analysis.bottlenecks.len());

for bottleneck in analysis.bottlenecks {
    println!("Bottleneck at node {}: {}", bottleneck.node_id, bottleneck.reason);
    println!("Suggested fix: {}", bottleneck.suggestion);
}
```

### 2. Knowledge Discovery
```rust
// Discover hidden relationships in concept graph
let knowledge = abstraction.get_graph(graph_id, "concept").await?;
let agent = KnowledgeGraphAgent::new();

let relationships = agent.discover_relationships(&knowledge).await?;
for rel in relationships {
    println!("Found relationship: {} --{}-> {}", 
        rel.source, rel.relationship_type, rel.target);
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Transformation
```rust
// AI-suggested graph transformation
let source = abstraction.get_graph(graph_id, "workflow").await?;
let agent = TransformationAgent::new();

let target_type = agent.suggest_target_type(&source, "visualization").await?;
println!("Agent suggests transforming to: {}", target_type);

let transformed = transformer.transform(&source, &target_type, options)?;
let quality = agent.evaluate_transformation(&source, &transformed).await?;
println!("Transformation quality score: {:.2}", quality.score);
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Hallucination Prevention**: Validate all AI suggestions against graph constraints
2. **Performance Degradation**: Implement caching and rate limiting
3. **User Trust**: Provide clear explanations for all agent actions
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive graph data is not sent to external APIs

## Conclusion

The AI Agent Integration will transform CIM from a powerful graph management system into an intelligent platform that actively helps users optimize their workflows, discover insights, and make better decisions. By leveraging the Graph Abstraction Layer, agents can work seamlessly across all graph types, providing consistent and valuable assistance throughout the system.
