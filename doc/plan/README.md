## Quick Start Guide

1. **For Product Owners**: Start with [01-requirements-overview.md](01-requirements-overview.md) and [04-user-stories.md](04-user-stories.md)
2. **For Developers**: Focus on [02-domain-model.md](02-domain-model.md) and [03-technical-architecture.md](03-technical-architecture.md)
3. **For Architects**: Review [03-technical-architecture.md](03-technical-architecture.md) and [05-non-functional-requirements.md](05-non-functional-requirements.md)
4. **For Project Managers**: See [06-implementation-phases.md](06-implementation-phases.md) for timeline and resource planning

## Key Technologies

- **Language**: Rust
- **Game Engine**: Bevy 0.16.0 (ECS architecture)
- **Graph Libraries**: petgraph 0.8+, daggy 0.9+
- **Messaging**: NATS JetStream
- **UI**: bevy_egui 0.34+
- **Build System**: Nix (deterministic builds)
- **Rendering**: WebGPU/Vulkan

## Core Principles

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All state changes through events
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear bounded contexts and ubiquitous language
3. **Entity-Component-System**: Modular, performant architecture
4. **Physics-Based Layout**: Natural graph organization using force-directed algorithms
5. **Composable Architecture**: "Lego block" approach to system design

## Project Goals

### Functional Goals
- Create, visualize, and manipulate complex graphs
- Support both 3D immersive and 2D overview modes
- Scale to 250,000+ graph elements
- Enable real-time collaboration

### Technical Goals
- Maintain 60 FPS with 1000+ visible nodes
- Event sourcing for complete audit trail
- Extensible through domain plugins
- Integration with CIM ecosystem

### User Experience Goals
- Intuitive interface (< 30 minutes to productivity)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Domain-specific customizations
- AI-assisted layout optimization

## Development Status

üöß **Current Phase**: Planning Complete
üìÖ **Estimated Timeline**: 12 months to v1.0
üë• **Team Required**: 4-5 developers

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve requirements documentation
2. Set up development environment with Nix
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Foundation)
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline

## Contributing

Please follow these guidelines when updating requirements:
- Maintain consistency with DDD naming conventions
