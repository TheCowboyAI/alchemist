# Plan Documentation

This directory contains active implementation plans for the Information Alchemist CIM project.

## Directory Structure

### ðŸ“‚ current/
**Active plans currently being executed**

- **[event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md](./current/event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md)** - Main 8-week phased implementation plan
- **[qa-remediation-plan.md](./current/qa-remediation-plan.md)** - Plan to address QA compliance gaps

### Completed Plans
Executed plans have been moved to `/doc/completed/`. These include:
- Integration testing framework
- Event separation refactoring
- External system integration design
- Domain modules implementation
- IPLD library extraction
- And many more...

## Current Implementation Status

### Active: Event Sourcing Implementation Plan
**8-week phased approach** (Currently in Week 3-4)

âœ… **Phase 0**: NATS Integration Foundation (Complete)
âœ… **Phase 1**: Distributed Event Infrastructure (Complete)
âœ… **Phase 1.5**: IPLD Integration (Complete)
ðŸš§ **Phase 2**: Graph Domain Model (60% Complete)
ðŸš§ **Phase 3**: CQRS Implementation (40% Complete)
ðŸ“… **Phase 4**: Conceptual Spaces (Pending)
ðŸ“… **Phase 5**: AI Agent Integration (Pending)
ðŸ“… **Phase 6**: Dog-fooding & Polish (Pending)

### Active: QA Remediation Plan
**Addressing compliance gaps**

âœ… Graph Aggregate implementation
âœ… Integration test suite creation
âœ… Read model projections
ðŸš§ Test coverage improvement (target: 80%)
ðŸ“… Remaining domain aggregates
ðŸ“… TDD documentation

## Success Metrics

### Achieved
- âœ… NATS integration working
- âœ… Event sourcing operational
- âœ… Graph aggregate complete
- âœ… Integration tests passing
- âœ… Projections implemented
- âœ… Application builds and runs

### In Progress
- ðŸš§ Test coverage: ~65% â†’ 80%
- ðŸš§ Domain model: 60% complete
- ðŸš§ CQRS: 40% complete

### Upcoming
- ðŸ“… Conceptual spaces
- ðŸ“… AI agent interface
- ðŸ“… Performance optimization
- ðŸ“… Multi-user collaboration

## Planning Process

1. **Draft** â†’ Initial plan creation in main folder
2. **Current** â†’ Move to `current/` when actively executing
3. **Completed** â†’ Move to `/doc/completed/` when done

## Quick Reference

### For Current Work
- Check [event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md](./current/event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md) for phase details
- Review [qa-remediation-plan.md](./current/qa-remediation-plan.md) for quality priorities

### For Understanding Past Decisions
- See `/doc/completed/` for executed plans
- Each completed plan contributed to the current state

## Next Major Milestones

1. **Complete Phase 2** - Finish domain model (Workflow, ConceptualSpace aggregates)
2. **Complete Phase 3** - Full CQRS with query handlers and snapshots
3. **Start Phase 4** - Conceptual spaces implementation
4. **Achieve 80% Test Coverage** - Critical quality gate

## Contributing

When creating new plans:
1. Start with clear objectives and success criteria
2. Break down into actionable tasks
3. Include timelines and dependencies
4. Move to `current/` when starting execution
5. Move to `/doc/completed/` when fully executed
