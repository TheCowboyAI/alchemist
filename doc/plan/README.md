# CIM-Integrated Event Sourcing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation plan for transforming Information Alchemist into a sophisticated CIM leaf node with event sourcing, NATS integration, conceptual spaces, and AI readiness.

## Current Plan

### ðŸ“‹ [event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md](./event-sourcing-implementation-plan.md)
**Active CIM Integration Plan**

8-week phased approach:
1. **Week 1**: NATS Integration Foundation
2. **Week 2**: Distributed Event Infrastructure
3. **Week 3**: Domain Model with CIM Extensions
4. **Week 4**: Conceptual Spaces Implementation
5. **Week 5**: Game Theory Components
6. **Week 6**: AI Agent Interface
7. **Week 7**: Full CIM Integration
8. **Week 8**: Advanced Features & Polish

2. **Integration Tests**: NATS communication
3. **System Tests**: Distributed functionality
4. **Performance Tests**: Scalability verification
5. **Acceptance Tests**: User feature validation

### Architecture Principles
```
Information Alchemist (CIM Leaf Node)
â”œâ”€â”€ Presentation Layer (Bevy ECS)
â”œâ”€â”€ Application Layer (CQRS)
â”œâ”€â”€ Domain Layer (Event Sourcing + Conceptual Spaces)
â””â”€â”€ Infrastructure Layer (NATS + Distributed Storage)
```

## Success Metrics

### Functional Goals
- Full CIM cluster integration
- NATS-based communication
- Distributed storage working

- [Published Documentation](../publish/)
- [CIM Research](../research/)
- [Vocabulary](../publish/vocabulary.md)

## Getting Started

1. Review the CIM architecture design
2. Set up NATS development environment
3. Follow the implementation plan phases
4. Test distributed functionality early
5. Benchmark performance continuously

The goal is to create a powerful UI for the CIM distributed backend, leveraging conceptual spaces for intuitive knowledge management and preparing for AI-enhanced workflows.
