# Organization Domain Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a component command handler system for the organization domain, following the same pattern established in the person domain.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component System Architecture
- Created `components` module with organization-specific component types
- Implemented `ComponentCommandHandler` for managing component operations
- Added infrastructure layer with `ComponentStore` and `EventStore`

### 2. Organization Component Types

#### Contact Components
- Phone numbers with extensions and departments
- Hours of operation
- Multiple contact types (Main, Sales, Support, Billing, Emergency)

#### Address Components  
- Multiple address types (Headquarters, Branch, Warehouse, Manufacturing)
- Primary, billing, and shipping address designations
- Full address validation

#### Certification Components
- ISO certifications (9001, 14001, 27001)
- Compliance certifications (SOC2, PCI-DSS)
- Licenses and accreditations
- Expiry tracking and status management

#### Industry Components
- Multiple classification systems (NAICS, SIC, ISIC, NACE)
- Primary/secondary industry designations
- Industry codes and descriptions

#### Financial Components
- Revenue ranges
- Employee count ranges
- Credit ratings
- DUNS numbers and tax IDs

#### Social Media Components
- Company profiles on major platforms
- Verification status
- Follower counts

#### Partnership Components
- Strategic, technology, channel partnerships
- Partner organization relationships
- Active/inactive status tracking

### 3. Command and Event Structure
- Created `ComponentCommand` enum with operations for each component type
- Implemented `ComponentDataEvent` enum for component state changes
- Added proper event sourcing with timestamps

### 4. Infrastructure
- `InMemoryComponentStore` for component storage
- `InMemoryEventStore` for event persistence
- Type-safe component retrieval with generics

### 5. Value Objects
- Added `PhoneNumber` value object with validation
- Added `Address` value object with formatting capabilities

## Testing
- All 53 existing tests pass
- Added component handler tests
- Component store integration tests

## Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Organizations can have any combination of components
2. **Type Safety**: Each component type is strongly typed
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new component types
4. **Consistency**: Follows same pattern as person domain
5. **Event Sourcing**: Full audit trail of component changes

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive tests for each component type
2. Implement component queries and projections
3. Add cross-domain integration with location domain
4. Consider adding component validation rules
5. Implement component versioning for schema evolution
