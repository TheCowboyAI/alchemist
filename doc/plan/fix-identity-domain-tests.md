# Fix Identity Domain Tests Plan

## Overview

The identity domain tests were written against an assumed API that doesn't match the actual implementation. This plan outlines the fixes needed to align the tests with the actual domain model.

## Key API Differences Found

### 1. Command Structure Differences
- `UpdatePhone` command has `phone_number` field, not `new_phone`
- `UpdateAddress` command has `address` field, not `new_address`
- No `UpdateMetadata` command exists in PersonCommand or OrganizationCommand

### 2. Event Structure Differences
- `PhoneUpdated` event only has `phone_number` field (no old_phone, new_phone, metadata)
- `AddressUpdated` event only has `address` field (no old_address, new_address, metadata)
- No `MetadataUpdated` event exists
- No `PersonCreated` event - it's `PersonRegistered`

### 3. EventMetadata Structure
The actual EventMetadata from cim_domain has these fields:
- `source`
- `version`
- `propagation_scope`
- `properties`

Not these (which tests expect):
- `timestamp`
- `correlation_id`
- `causation_id`
- `actor_id`

### 4. Aggregate Structure
- Person aggregate doesn't have a `metadata` field
- Organization aggregate doesn't have `members` or `metadata` fields
- Method is `apply_event` not `apply_events`
- PhoneNumber doesn't have a `new` constructor

### 5. Value Object APIs
- Email has a `new` constructor that returns Result<Email, IdentityError>
- Address doesn't have Optional state field - it's required
- PhoneNumber is a simple struct with public fields, no constructor

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Command Tests (command_tests.rs)

1. Update phone command tests:
   ```rust
   // OLD
   PersonCommand::UpdatePhone { new_phone: Some(phone) }
   // NEW
   PersonCommand::UpdatePhone { phone_number: phone }
   ```

2. Update address command tests:
   ```rust
   // OLD
   PersonCommand::UpdateAddress { new_address: Some(address) }
   // NEW
   PersonCommand::UpdateAddress { address: address }
   ```

3. Remove all UpdateMetadata command tests

4. Fix Address construction (state is not optional):
   ```rust
   Address {
       street: "123 Main St".to_string(),
       city: "Boston".to_string(),
       state: "MA".to_string(), // Not Option<String>
       postal_code: "02101".to_string(),
       country: "USA".to_string(),
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Fix Event Tests (event_tests.rs)

1. Fix PhoneUpdated event:
   ```rust
   // OLD
   PersonEvent::PhoneUpdated {
       old_phone,
       new_phone,
       metadata,
   }
   // NEW
   PersonEvent::PhoneUpdated {
       person_id,
       phone_number,
   }
   ```

2. Fix AddressUpdated event:
   ```rust
   // OLD
   PersonEvent::AddressUpdated {
       old_address,
       new_address,
       metadata,
   }
   // NEW
   PersonEvent::AddressUpdated {
       person_id,
       address,
   }
   ```

3. Remove all MetadataUpdated event tests

4. Fix EventMetadata usage - remove it from domain events (they don't have metadata fields)

5. Change PersonCreated to PersonRegistered

### Step 3: Fix Aggregate Tests (aggregate_tests.rs)

1. Change `apply_events` to `apply_event`

2. Remove references to non-existent fields:
   - `person.metadata`
   - `org.metadata`
   - `org.members`

3. Fix error type matching:
   ```rust
   // OLD
   Err(DomainError::ValidationError(msg))
   // NEW
   Err(IdentityError::InvalidEmail(email))
   ```

4. Use proper field access (some fields might be private)

### Step 4: Fix PhoneNumber Construction

Since PhoneNumber doesn't have a `new` constructor, create instances directly:
```rust
PhoneNumber {
    country_code: "+44".to_string(),
    number: "7700900123".to_string(),
}
```

## Success Criteria

1. All tests compile without errors
2. All tests pass
3. Test coverage > 80% for domain logic
4. Tests follow TDD principles with clear Given/When/Then structure
5. Tests include mermaid diagrams in rustdocs

## Next Steps

1. Fix compilation errors in existing tests
2. Run tests to identify logic errors
3. Add missing test cases
4. Create integration tests
5. Document test patterns for other domains to follow

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Command tests compile and pass
- [ ] Event tests compile and pass  
- [ ] Aggregate tests compile and pass
- [ ] All identity domain tests pass

## Completion Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - 2025-01-12

All identity domain tests have been successfully fixed and are now passing:

- **Command Tests**: 10/10 passing
- **Event Tests**: 9/9 passing
- **Aggregate Tests**: 10/10 passing
- **Integration Tests**: 5/5 passing
- **Unit Tests**: 1/1 passing

**Total**: 35 tests passing in the identity domain

### Key Learnings

1. **API Alignment**: Tests must match the actual implementation, not assumed APIs
2. **Event Structure**: Domain events in this implementation don't carry metadata
3. **Value Objects**: Simple structs without constructors in many cases
4. **Error Types**: Domain-specific error types (IdentityError) with specific variants
5. **No Metadata Fields**: Person and Organization aggregates don't have generic metadata fields

This experience reinforces the importance of understanding the actual domain model before writing tests
