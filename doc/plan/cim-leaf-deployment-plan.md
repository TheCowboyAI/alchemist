# CIM Leaf Deployment Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of critical functionality to enable production deployment of CIM Leaf nodes with intelligent agent collaboration. The plan focuses on three core pillars:

1. **Graph to Nix Translation** - Convert visual infrastructure designs to deployable NixOS configurations
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Enable agents to collaborate, share knowledge, and make decisions
3. **Agent-Infrastructure Bridge** - Allow agents to manage and reason about deployed infrastructure

## Timeline: 6-8 Weeks

    let graph = create_test_deployment_graph();
    
    // 2. Initialize agents
    let agents = spawn_test_agents(5).await;
    
    // 3. Agents discuss deployment
    let dialog = agents.start_deployment_discussion(&graph).await;
    assert!(dialog.reaches_consensus_within(Duration::from_secs(30)));
    
    // 4. Generate flake.nix
    let flake = graph.to_flake_nix().await?;
    assert!(flake.is_valid());
    
    // 5. Deploy with agent monitoring
    let deployment = agents.execute_deployment(&flake).await?;
    assert_eq!(deployment.status(), DeploymentStatus::Success);
    
    // 6. Verify knowledge sharing
    for agent in &agents {
        assert!(agent.has_knowledge_of(&deployment));
    }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Complex CRDT implementation → Use existing library (automerge)
   - NATS performance → Implement batching and compression
   - Nix generation complexity → Incremental implementation with templates

2. **Timeline Risks**:
   - Feature creep → Strict scope management
   - Integration complexity → Daily integration tests
   - Performance issues → Early benchmarking

## Conclusion

This plan provides a clear path to implementing the critical functionality for CIM Leaf deployment with intelligent agent collaboration. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery while ensuring all components work together in the final system.
