# Graph Abstraction Layer - Phase 4: Integration and Polish

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on integrating the graph abstraction layer into the main CIM application and adding polish through documentation, performance optimizations, and additional examples.

## Goals

1. **Integration with Main Application**
   - Integrate abstraction layer into cim-domain-graph systems
   - Update Bevy ECS systems to use abstraction layer
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Architecture guide for the abstraction layer
   - Migration guide for existing code

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmark current performance
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Add caching where appropriate

4. **Additional Examples**
   - Real-world use cases
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Integration patterns

## Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Main Application Integration

#### 4.1.1 Update Graph Systems
- [ ] Update `GraphCreationSystem` to use abstraction layer
- [ ] Update `NodeManagementSystem` to work with abstract graphs
- [ ] Update `EdgeManagementSystem` for abstract operations
- [ ] Update `GraphQuerySystem` to use abstract queries

#### 4.1.2 Update Command Handlers
- [ ] Modify `GraphCommandHandler` to delegate to abstraction layer
- [ ] Update command processing to support all graph types
- [ ] Ensure events are properly generated

#### 4.1.3 Update Query Handlers
- [ ] Integrate `AbstractGraphQueryHandler` into main query flow
- [ ] Add support for cross-graph queries
- [ ] Implement caching for common queries

### 4.2 Documentation
