# 3D Graph Editor Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for a 3D-enabled graph editor built using Bevy v0.16.0, following CIM (Composable Information Machine) principles and ECS architecture. The system will support both 3D and 2D viewing modes within a single viewport, with tools for creating and manipulating domain-driven workflow graphs.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
- **ECS-Driven Design**: All graph elements are entities with components
- **Event-Sourced State**: Graph modifications produce events in an append-only log
- **Domain-Driven Boundaries**: Clear separation between graph domain, UI domain, and camera systems
- **Composable Modules**: Each system is a reusable "Lego block" following CIM architecture

## Phase 1: Foundation Components (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Graph Core Components
```rust
// Components for graph entities
#[derive(Component)]
struct GraphNode {
    id: Uuid,
    domain_type: DomainNodeType,
    position: Vec3,
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct GraphEdge {
    id: Uuid,
    source: Entity,
    target: Entity,
    edge_type: DomainEdgeType,
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct GraphContainer {
    nodes: Vec<Entity>,
    edges: Vec<Entity>,
}
```

### 1.2 Camera System Components
```rust
#[derive(Component)]
enum CameraMode {
    ThreeD { orbit_state: OrbitState },
    TwoD { fixed_height: f32 },
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct GraphCamera {
    mode: CameraMode,
    transition_state: Option<TransitionState>,
}
```

### 1.3 Event Definitions
```rust
#[derive(Event)]
enum GraphEvent {
    NodeCreated { id: Uuid, position: Vec3, domain_type: DomainNodeType },
    NodeMoved { id: Uuid, from: Vec3, to: Vec3 },
    EdgeCreated { id: Uuid, source: Uuid, target: Uuid },
    EdgeDeleted { id: Uuid },
}
```

## Phase 2: Core Systems Implementation (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Graph Management Systems
- **GraphSpawnSystem**: Handles node/edge entity creation from events
- **GraphLayoutSystem**: Manages automatic layout algorithms
- **GraphValidationSystem**: Ensures domain constraints are met
- **GraphPersistenceSystem**: Serializes graph state to NATS JetStream

### 2.2 Camera Control Systems
- **CameraTransitionSystem**: Smoothly transitions between 2D/3D modes
- **OrbitCameraSystem**: Handles 3D pan/orbit controls
- **FixedCameraSystem**: Manages 2D top-down view
- **CameraInputSystem**: Processes user input for camera control

### 2.3 Rendering Systems
- **NodeRenderSystem**: Draws graph nodes with domain-specific visuals
- **EdgeRenderSystem**: Renders connections with appropriate styling
- **GridRenderSystem**: Shows reference grid in both view modes
- **SelectionRenderSystem**: Highlights selected elements

## Phase 3: UI and Tools Integration (Week 3-4)

### 3.1 Egui Integration
```rust
pub struct GraphToolsPlugin;

impl Plugin for GraphToolsPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_plugins(EguiPlugin)
           .add_systems(Update, (
               render_tools_panel,
               handle_tool_interactions,
           ).chain());
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Tool Components
- **NodeCreationTool**: Click-to-place nodes with domain type selection
- **EdgeCreationTool**: Drag between nodes to create edges
- **SelectionTool**: Box select, multi-select with modifiers
- **LayoutTool**: Apply force-directed or hierarchical layouts

### 3.3 Property Panels
- Node properties editor (domain-specific fields)
- Edge properties editor (relationship types)
- Graph metadata panel
- View settings panel

## Phase 4: Domain Integration (Week 4-5)

### 4.1 Domain Model Mapping
- Map business workflows to graph structures
- Define node types for domain concepts
- Establish edge types for relationships
- Create validation rules for domain constraints

### 4.2 Conceptual Space Integration
- Implement spatial representation of domain concepts
- Create similarity-based node positioning
- Enable semantic clustering visualization
- Support concept navigation

### 4.3 Event Stream Processing
- Connect to NATS JetStream for event persistence
- Implement event replay for graph reconstruction
- Enable collaborative editing through event sharing
- Support undo/redo via event sourcing

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

### 5.1 AI Agent Integration
- Create AI-assisted layout suggestions
- Implement pattern recognition for common workflows
- Enable natural language graph queries
- Support automated graph optimization

### 5.2 Performance Optimization
- Implement frustum culling for large graphs
- Use GPU instancing for node rendering
- Create level-of-detail system for zoomed-out views
- Optimize edge rendering with batching

### 5.3 Persistence and Serialization
- Graph format specification (compatible with common formats)
- NATS JetStream integration for distributed state
- Local caching with Nix-managed storage
- Import/export capabilities

## Implementation Guidelines

### ECS Best Practices
1. Keep components atomic and focused
2. Use events for cross-system communication
3. Leverage Bevy's parallel execution
4. Design queries around archetype boundaries

### Code Organization
```
src/
  graph/
    components.rs    // Graph-specific components
    systems.rs       // Graph manipulation systems
    events.rs        // Graph event definitions
    plugin.rs        // GraphPlugin definition
  camera/
    components.rs    // Camera components
    systems.rs       // Camera control systems
    plugin.rs        // CameraPlugin definition
  ui/
    tools/          // Tool implementations
    panels/         // UI panel systems
    plugin.rs       // UIPlugin definition
  domain/
    models.rs       // Domain type definitions
    validation.rs   // Domain constraint systems
    plugin.rs       // DomainPlugin definition
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for system interactions
3. Property-based tests for graph algorithms
4. Performance benchmarks for rendering

### Deployment Considerations
- Use Nix flakes for reproducible builds
- Package as composable Bevy plugin
- Document domain configuration options
- Provide example domain implementations

## Success Metrics
- Smooth 60 FPS with 1000+ nodes
- Sub-100ms camera mode transitions
- Intuitive tool interactions
- Domain expert approval of workflow representation
- Successful integration with CIM event streams

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance**: Early profiling and optimization
- **Complexity**: Incremental feature addition
- **Domain Alignment**: Regular stakeholder feedback
- **Technical Debt**: Continuous refactoring cycles

## Timeline Summary
- Week 1-2: Foundation components and basic systems
- Week 2-3: Core functionality implementation
- Week 3-4: UI and tools integration
- Week 4-5: Domain-specific features
- Week 5-6: Polish and optimization

This plan provides a structured approach to building a robust 3D graph editor that aligns with CIM principles while leveraging Bevy's ECS architecture for maximum performance and maintainability.
