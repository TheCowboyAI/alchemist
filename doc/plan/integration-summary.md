# Integration Summary: 3D Graph Editor Components and Systems

## Overview

We have successfully integrated the component and system architecture from our plan into the existing Alchemist codebase. Here's what we've accomplished:

## Module Structure

### 1. Camera Module (`src/camera/`)
Created a complete camera system with dual-mode viewing:

- **components.rs**: Defines camera components following ECS principles
  - `GraphViewCamera`: Main camera component with 2D/3D modes
  - `ViewMode`: Enum for ThreeD and TwoD states
  - `CameraTransition`: Smooth transitions between modes
  - `ViewportConfig`: Manages viewport layout with UI panels
  - `GraphBounds`: Tracks graph boundaries for camera calculations

- **systems.rs**: Camera control and update systems
  - `update_camera_system`: Updates camera transform based on mode
  - `camera_transition_system`: Handles smooth mode transitions
  - `orbit_camera_input_system`: 3D orbit controls (mouse + keyboard)
  - `pan_camera_input_system`: 2D pan controls
  - `switch_view_mode`: Tab/V key switching between modes
  - `update_viewport_system`: Adjusts viewport for UI panels
  - Performance systems: frustum culling and LOD

- **plugin.rs**: `CameraViewportPlugin` that registers all systems

### 2. Graph Core Module (`src/graph_core/`)
Created a new graph system following ECS architecture:

- **components.rs**: Graph entity components
  - `GraphNode`: Core node component with domain type
  - `GraphEdge`: Edge component with source/target entities
  - `GraphPosition`: 3D position component
  - `Selected`/`Hovered`: State components
  - `NodeVisual`/`EdgeVisual`: Visual representation
  - Domain types for business logic integration

- **events.rs**: Event-driven architecture
  - Creation events: `CreateNodeEvent`, `CreateEdgeEvent`
  - Modification events: `MoveNodeEvent`, `DeleteNodeEvent`
  - Interaction events: `SelectEvent`, `HoverEvent`
  - System events: `LayoutUpdateEvent`, `ValidateGraphEvent`
  - `GraphModificationEvent`: Unified event for event sourcing

- **systems.rs**: Graph manipulation systems
  - `handle_create_node_events`: Spawns node entities
  - `handle_create_edge_events`: Creates edge entities
  - `handle_selection_events`: Manages selection state
  - `update_edge_positions`: Keeps edges aligned with nodes
  - `update_node_visuals`: Updates appearance based on state

- **rendering.rs**: Dual-mode rendering
  - `render_graph_nodes`: Switches between 3D spheres and 2D circles
  - `render_graph_edges`: 3D cylinders or 2D rectangles
  - `render_reference_grid`: 3D grid plane for spatial reference

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. ECS Architecture
- All graph elements are entities with focused components
- Systems communicate through events (no direct coupling)
- Components are atomic and reusable

### 2. Dual-Mode Viewing
- Single viewport with mode switching (not multiple cameras)
- Smooth transitions with interpolation
- Mode-appropriate rendering (3D meshes vs 2D shapes)

### 3. Event-Driven Updates
- All graph modifications go through events
- Events enable undo/redo and persistence
- Clear separation between input, logic, and rendering

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Frustum culling for large graphs
- Level-of-detail system for 2D zoom
- Batched operations where possible

## Integration with Existing Code

- Created `graph_core` module to avoid conflict with existing `graph.rs`
- Maintains compatibility with existing graph structures
- Can be used alongside existing editors (Graph, Workflow, DDD, ECS)

## Next Steps

1. **Input Handling**: Add mouse picking/selection in both modes
2. **Tools Integration**: Create node/edge creation tools
3. **Layout Algorithms**: Implement force-directed and hierarchical layouts
4. **Domain Integration**: Connect to business workflow concepts
5. **NATS Integration**: Add event persistence to JetStream

## Usage Example

```rust
// Add plugins
app.add_plugins(CameraViewportPlugin)
   .add_plugins(GraphPlugin);

// Create nodes via events
create_node_events.send(CreateNodeEvent {
    id: Uuid::new_v4(),
    position: Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    domain_type: DomainNodeType::Process,
    name: "Start Node".to_string(),
    subgraph_id: None,
});

// Camera automatically handles 3D/2D switching with Tab key
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the 3D graph editor while following the CIM principles of composability and event-driven architecture.
