- `/src/application/projections/graph_summary.rs`
- `/src/application/projections/node_list.rs`
- `/src/application/query_handlers/graph_queries.rs`

## Priority 2: Short-term Actions (Complete within 2 weeks)

### 1. Increase Test Coverage to 80%

- [ ] Design quality dimensions
- [ ] Implement convex regions
- [ ] Add similarity metrics

### 2. Add Game Theory Components (Phase 4)
- [ ] Strategy system design
- [ ] Utility calculations
- [ ] Coalition formation

### 3. Build AI Agent Interface (Phase 5)
- [ ] Agent communication protocol
- [ ] Discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Analysis workflows

### 4. Complete CIM Integration (Phase 6)
- [ ] Distributed queries
- [ ] Multi-node collaboration
- [ ] Synchronization protocols

## Implementation Schedule

### Week 1
- Monday-Tuesday: Complete domain aggregate
- Wednesday-Thursday: Create integration tests
- Friday: Start read model projections

### Week 2
- Monday-Tuesday: Finish read model projections
- Wednesday: Update progress.json
- Thursday-Friday: Begin test coverage improvements

### Week 3
- Complete Phase 2 domain model
- Document TDD process
- Add performance benchmarks

### Week 4+
- Begin Phase 3 conceptual spaces
- Continue with subsequent phases

## Success Criteria

1. **Domain Aggregate**: All commands handled, 100% test coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: 10+ end-to-end scenarios passing
3. **Read Models**: 4+ projections with query handlers
4. **Test Coverage**: Overall coverage ≥ 80%
5. **Documentation**: TDD process documented with examples
6. **Performance**: Benchmarks established with baselines

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Debt**: Address as part of implementation, not separately
2. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined tasks, defer enhancements
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure NATS server available for all tests
4. **Performance**: Monitor build times, keep tests fast

## Verification

After each priority level completion:
1. Run full test suite
2. Check code coverage metrics
3. Verify architectural compliance
4. Update progress tracking
5. Conduct mini QA review

This plan provides a clear path to address all identified issues while maintaining project momentum.
