# Dog-Fooding Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of dog-fooding capabilities in Information Alchemist, allowing it to visualize its own development journey through both progress tracking and git integration.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Progress Graph Loader (Week 3, during Phase 2)

**Goal**: Enable loading and visualizing progress.json as a graph

**Tasks**:
1. Create `ProgressGraphLoader` component
   - Parse progress.json format
   - Convert to domain Graph structure
   - Preserve metadata and relationships

2. Implement progress-specific node types
   - `NodeType::Milestone`
   - `NodeType::Phase`
   - `NodeType::Task`

3. Add progress visualization mode
   - Timeline layout for sequential progress
   - Hierarchical layout for task breakdown
   - Status-based coloring (completed, in-progress, planned)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can load progress.json and display as interactive graph
- Visual distinction between different node types and statuses
- Proper edge relationships showing dependencies

### Phase 2: Git Integration Foundation (Week 4, during Phase 3)

**Goal**: Transform git history into graph events

**Tasks**:
1. Create `GitEventSource` infrastructure
   - Git log parser using `git2` crate
   - Convert commits to `GitEvent` enum
   - Map git events to domain events

2. Implement git-specific node types
   - `NodeType::GitCommit`
   - `NodeType::GitBranch`
   - `NodeType::GitTag`
   - `NodeType::GitMerge`

3. Create git graph builder
   - Build graph from repository history
   - Maintain parent-child relationships
   - Extract metadata (author, date, files)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can parse local git repository
- Generate accurate commit graph
- Preserve all git relationships

### Phase 3: Dual Graph Visualization (Week 5, during Phase 4)

**Goal**: Display planned vs actual progress simultaneously

**Tasks**:
1. Implement `DevelopmentDashboard` component
   - Split-screen or overlay visualization
   - Synchronize time scales
   - Correlation mapping between plans and commits

2. Create variance analysis
   - Compare planned dates vs actual commits
   - Identify delays and accelerations
   - Calculate velocity metrics

3. Add interactive features
   - Click to show related commits for a phase
   - Highlight unplanned work
   - Time slider for temporal navigation

**Success Criteria**:
- Can view both graphs simultaneously
- Clear visual correlation between plans and implementation
- Actionable insights from variance analysis

### Phase 4: Real-Time Git Monitoring (Week 6, during Phase 5)

**Goal**: Stream git events through NATS as they happen

**Tasks**:
1. Implement git hooks
   - Post-commit hook to capture new commits
   - Post-merge hook for branch merges
   - Tag creation hook

2. Create `GitEventPublisher`
   - Convert git hook data to NATS messages
   - Publish to `development.events.*` subjects
   - Include relevant metadata

3. Add live update system
   - Subscribe to git events in UI
   - Update graphs in real-time
   - Show notifications for new activity

**Success Criteria**:
- Git hooks properly installed and functioning
- Events published to NATS successfully
- UI updates immediately on new commits

### Phase 5: Development Analytics (Week 7, during Phase 6)

**Goal**: Provide insights and patterns from development data

**Tasks**:
1. Implement pattern detection
   - Refactoring cycles
   - Collaboration clusters
   - Technical debt accumulation

2. Create metrics dashboard
   - Commit frequency
   - Code churn
   - Test coverage trends
   - Build performance

3. Add predictive analytics
   - Completion projections
   - Risk identification
   - Resource recommendations

**Success Criteria**:
- Meaningful patterns detected
- Accurate metrics calculation
- Useful predictions and recommendations

### Phase 6: Self-Improvement Loop (Week 8, during Phase 7)

**Goal**: Use insights to improve Information Alchemist itself

**Tasks**:
1. Create feedback mechanism
   - Automated issue creation from insights
   - Performance optimization suggestions
   - Architecture improvement recommendations

2. Implement development AI assistant
   - Analyze commit patterns
   - Suggest refactoring opportunities
   - Identify knowledge gaps

3. Add collaborative features
   - Share insights with team
   - Collaborative annotation
   - Knowledge preservation

**Success Criteria**:
- Actionable improvements identified
- Measurable impact on development velocity
- Enhanced team collaboration

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- `git2` crate for git operations
- `chrono` for time handling
- `serde_json` for progress.json parsing
- NATS client for event streaming

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large git histories
- Incremental updates for real-time monitoring
- Caching for expensive computations

### Security
- Sanitize git hook inputs
- Validate NATS message formats
- Respect repository permissions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Progress graph parsing
- Git event conversion
- Pattern detection algorithms

### Integration Tests
- Git repository interaction
- NATS event flow
- Real-time updates

### End-to-End Tests
- Full dashboard functionality
- Cross-graph correlation
- Analytics accuracy

## Documentation

### User Guide
- How to enable dog-fooding
- Understanding the visualizations
- Interpreting analytics

### Developer Guide
- Adding new patterns
- Extending git integration
- Custom analytics

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: Team actively uses dog-fooding features
2. **Insights**: At least 5 actionable insights per week
3. **Velocity**: 10% improvement in development speed
4. **Quality**: Reduced bug rate through early detection
5. **Knowledge**: Better understanding of codebase evolution

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Slows down development environment
- **Mitigation**: Async processing, configurable features

### Information Overload
- **Risk**: Too many insights, not actionable
- **Mitigation**: Prioritization, filtering, summaries

### Privacy Concerns
- **Risk**: Exposes sensitive development data
- **Mitigation**: Local processing, opt-in sharing

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Progress Loader | View progress.json as graph |
| 4 | Git Integration | Git history visualization |
| 5 | Dual Graph | Planned vs actual view |
| 6 | Real-Time | Live development updates |
| 7 | Analytics | Patterns and insights |
| 8 | Self-Improvement | Automated recommendations |

## Conclusion

By implementing these dog-fooding capabilities, Information Alchemist becomes a living example of its own power, continuously improving through self-observation and creating a virtuous cycle of development excellence.
