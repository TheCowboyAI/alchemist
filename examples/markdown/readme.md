## Example Workflow

Here's a simple content creation workflow:

```yaml
name: content-creation
agents:
  - name: researcher
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: "Research the topic and provide key insights"
  
  - name: writer
    model: claude-2
    prompt: "Write an article based on the research"
  
  - name: editor
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: "Edit and improve the article"

connections:
