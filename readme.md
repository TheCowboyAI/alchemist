# Alchemist - Transform Information into Understanding

![The Alchemist](./alchemist.webp)

> "Where data becomes knowledge through the magic of visualization"

## What is Alchemist?

Alchemist is a revolutionary 3D graph visualization and editing system that transforms how we understand and interact with complex information. Imagine being able to see your data come alive in three-dimensional space, where relationships dance before your eyes and patterns emerge naturally from the chaos.

As the primary interface for the **Composable Information Machine (CIM)**, Alchemist doesn't just display data‚Äîit creates an immersive environment where information flows, evolves, and connects in ways that mirror how our minds naturally process knowledge.

### ALL EVENTS ARE PERSISTED AND ALL CODE IS VERSION CONTROLLED.

### EACH MODULE HAS AN EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING ITS USAGE

### See Your World in Graphs
- **3D Immersive Exploration**: Navigate through your data like exploring a new world
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Watch as changes ripple through the graph in real-time
- **Semantic Understanding**: AI-powered insights that understand meaning, not just structure
- **Visual Workflows**: Design and execute business processes by drawing them

### Built for the Real World
Whether you're mapping customer journeys, visualizing software architectures, or exploring knowledge relationships, Alchemist adapts to your needs:

- **Business Intelligence**: Transform spreadsheets into living, breathing visualizations
- **Software Architecture**: See your system's true structure and dependencies
- **Knowledge Management**: Navigate concepts and ideas in semantic space
- **Workflow Design**: Draw your processes and watch them execute

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter the magical realm
git clone https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/alchemist
cd alchemist

# Using Nix (recommended for reproducible builds)
nix develop
nix run

# Or using Cargo directly
cargo run --release
```

Once running, you'll see a beautiful 3D graph spring to life. Use your mouse to navigate and explore!

## üéØ What Makes Alchemist Special?

### The Composable Information Machine (CIM)
At its heart, Alchemist is powered by CIM‚Äîa revolutionary architecture where:
- **Everything is an Event**: Every change is recorded, creating a perfect history
- **Graphs are Fundamental**: All information is represented as interconnected graphs
- **AI-Native Design**: Built from the ground up to work with intelligent agents
- **Semantic Understanding**: Conceptual spaces that understand meaning, not just data

### Key Innovations
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Zero data loss, perfect audit trails, time-travel debugging
- **Dual ECS Systems**: Lightning-fast rendering with Bevy while maintaining domain integrity
- **Conceptual Spaces**: Every piece of information exists in both visual and semantic dimensions
- **Self-Referential**: Alchemist can visualize its own development and architecture

## üöß Development Status

**üìä FOUNDATION COMPLETE: Domain Architecture Established (14/14 domains)**

Alchemist and the Composable Information Machine (CIM) have completed the foundational architecture with all domain modules structured and basic tests passing. However, significant work remains to create a fully functional system.

**‚úÖ What's Complete:**
- **Domain Structure**: All 14 domains have been scaffolded with proper DDD architecture
- **Event-Driven Foundation**: Basic event sourcing and CQRS patterns implemented
- **Test Infrastructure**: 187+ unit tests passing (mostly testing basic domain logic)
- **Build System**: All modules compile without errors

**üöß What's In Progress:**
- **Actual Functionality**: Most features are stubbed but not fully implemented
- **UI/UX**: No working user interface for graph manipulation
- **Workflows**: Workflow execution engine not connected to visual interface
- **Integration**: Domains exist in isolation, limited cross-domain functionality
- **Real-World Usage**: Cannot yet perform advertised features

**‚ùå What's Missing:**
- Working 3D graph visualization and editing
- Functional workflow designer and executor
- AI agent integration beyond basic structure
- Actual business value delivery
- Performance optimization for production use
- Security and authentication implementation
- Multi-user collaboration features

**üìã Completed Domains (Structure Only):**
1. **Graph Domain** (90 tests) - Basic graph operations, abstraction layer designed
2. **Identity Domain** (54 tests) - Identity models defined, no auth implementation
3. **Person Domain** (2 tests) - Basic person entity structure
4. **Agent Domain** (5 tests) - AI agent foundation sketched
5. **Git Domain** - Git integration planned, basic event mapping
6. **Location Domain** (29 tests) - Geographic models defined
7. **ConceptualSpaces Domain** - Semantic model outlined
8. **Workflow Domain** - State machine structure, no execution
9. **Bevy Domain** (7 tests) - Visual bridge scaffolded
10. **Dialog Domain** - Conversation structure defined
11. **Document Domain** - Document models outlined
12. **Nix Domain** - Configuration structure planned
13. **Organization Domain** - Org hierarchy modeled
14. **Policy Domain** - Rule engine structure defined

**üéØ Reality Check:**
- **Architecture**: ‚úÖ Well-designed DDD/CQRS/Event Sourcing foundation
- **Implementation**: üü° Basic structure complete, core functionality missing
- **User Experience**: ‚ùå No working UI or user-facing features
- **Business Value**: ‚ùå Cannot deliver on promised capabilities yet
- **Production Ready**: ‚ùå Significant development required

**üöÄ Next Major Milestones:**
1. **Bevy UI Implementation**: Create actual 3D graph visualization
2. **Workflow Execution**: Connect workflow engine to visual designer
3. **Domain Integration**: Wire domains together for real functionality
4. **User Interface**: Build interactive graph editing capabilities
5. **Persistence Layer**: Implement actual NATS event store integration
6. **Authentication**: Add real security and multi-user support

**üìà Honest Metrics:**
- Domain Architecture: 90% complete
- Core Functionality: 20% complete
- User Interface: 5% complete
- Production Features: 0% complete
- Overall Project: ~25% complete

This is a solid foundation, but significant development work remains to deliver on the vision of a working 3D graph visualization and workflow system.
