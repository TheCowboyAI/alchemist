# Alchemist - Transform Information into Understanding

![The Alchemist](./alchemist.webp)

> "Where data becomes knowledge through the magic of visualization"

## What is Alchemist?

Alchemist is a revolutionary 3D graph visualization and editing system that transforms how we understand and interact with complex information. Imagine being able to see your data come alive in three-dimensional space, where relationships dance before your eyes and patterns emerge naturally from the chaos.

As the primary interface for the **Composable Information Machine (CIM)**, Alchemist doesn't just display data‚Äîit creates an immersive environment where information flows, evolves, and connects in ways that mirror how our minds naturally process knowledge.

## üåü Experience the Magic

### See Your World in Graphs
- **3D Immersive Exploration**: Navigate through your data like exploring a new world
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Watch as changes ripple through the graph in real-time
- **Semantic Understanding**: AI-powered insights that understand meaning, not just structure
- **Visual Workflows**: Design and execute business processes by drawing them

### Built for the Real World
Whether you're mapping customer journeys, visualizing software architectures, or exploring knowledge relationships, Alchemist adapts to your needs:

- **Business Intelligence**: Transform spreadsheets into living, breathing visualizations
- **Software Architecture**: See your system's true structure and dependencies
- **Knowledge Management**: Navigate concepts and ideas in semantic space
- **Workflow Design**: Draw your processes and watch them execute

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and enter the magical realm
git clone https://github.com/TheCowboyAI/alchemist
cd alchemist

# Using Nix (recommended for reproducible builds)
nix develop
nix run

# Or using Cargo directly
cargo run --release
```

Once running, you'll see a beautiful 3D graph spring to life. Use your mouse to navigate and explore!

## üéØ What Makes Alchemist Special?

### The Composable Information Machine (CIM)
At its heart, Alchemist is powered by CIM‚Äîa revolutionary architecture where:
- **Everything is an Event**: Every change is recorded, creating a perfect history
- **Graphs are Fundamental**: All information is represented as interconnected graphs
- **AI-Native Design**: Built from the ground up to work with intelligent agents
- **Semantic Understanding**: Conceptual spaces that understand meaning, not just data

### Key Innovations
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Zero data loss, perfect audit trails, time-travel debugging
- **Dual ECS Systems**: Lightning-fast rendering with Bevy while maintaining domain integrity
- **Conceptual Spaces**: Every piece of information exists in both visual and semantic dimensions
- **Self-Referential**: Alchemist can visualize its own development and architecture
